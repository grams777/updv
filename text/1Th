1:1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> and peace.
1:2 We give thanks to God always for all of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, making mention [of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>] in our prayers without ceasing, 
1:3 remembering your<sup><small>+</small></sup> work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father; 
1:4 knowing, brothers beloved by God, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> election, 
1:5 how that our good news did not come to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; even as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know what manner of men we showed ourselves among you<sup><small>+</small></sup> for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sake. 
1:6 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit; 
1:7 so that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia. 
1:8 For from you<sup><small>+</small></sup> has sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your<sup><small>+</small></sup> faith toward God has gone forth; so that we don't need to speak anything. 
1:9 For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; and how you<sup><small>+</small></sup> turned to God from idols, to serve as slaves to a living and true God, 
1:10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.
2:1 For yourselves, brothers, know our entering in to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that it has not been found vain: 
2:2 but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the good news of God in much conflict. 
2:3 For our exhortation [is] not of error, nor of impurity, nor in guile: 
2:4 but even as we have been approved of God to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God who proves our hearts. 
2:5 For neither at any time did we come in words of flattery, as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know, nor in a cloak of greed, God is witness; 
2:6 nor seeking glory of men, neither from you<sup><small>+</small></sup> nor from others. 
2:7 We could have been a burden as apostles of Christ. But we became juveniles among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, as when a nurse cherishes her own children: 
2:8 even so, being affectionately desirous of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, we were well pleased to impart to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, not the good news of God only, but also our own souls, because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> became very dear to us. 
2:9 For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> remember, brothers, our labor and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, we preached to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the good news of God. 
2:10 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are witnesses, and God [also], how holily and righteously and unblamably we became toward you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who believe: 
2:11 as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know how we [dealt with] each one of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, as a father with his own children, 
2:12 exhorting you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and encouraging, and testifying, to the end that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> should walk worthily of God, who calls you<sup><small>+</small></sup> into his own kingdom and glory.
2:13 And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> received from us the word of the message, [even the word] of God, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> accepted [it] not [as] the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who believe. 
2:14 For you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus: for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also suffered the same things of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews; 
2:15 who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove out us, and do not please God, and are contrary to all men; 
2:16 forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath has come upon them to the uttermost.
2:17 But we, brothers, being bereaved of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more exceedingly to see your<sup><small>+</small></sup> face with great desire: 
2:18 because we wanted to come to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us. 
2:19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, before our Lord Jesus at his coming? 
2:20 For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are our glory and our joy.
3:1 Therefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone; 
3:2 and sent Timothy, our brother and coworker under God in the good news of Christ, to establish you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and to comfort [you<sup><small>+</small></sup>] concerning your<sup><small>+</small></sup> faith; 
3:3 that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed. 
3:4 For truly, when we were with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, we told you<sup><small>+</small></sup> beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know. 
3:5 For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your<sup><small>+</small></sup> faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and our labor should be in vain. 
3:6 But when Timothy came even now to us from you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and brought us good news about your<sup><small>+</small></sup> faith and love, and that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also [to see] you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; 
3:7 for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in all our distress and affliction through your<sup><small>+</small></sup> faith: 
3:8 for now we live, if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> stand fast in the Lord. 
3:9 For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, for all the joy with which we joy for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sakes before our God; 
3:10 night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your<sup><small>+</small></sup> face, and may provide that which is lacking in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> faith?
3:11 Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: 
3:12 and the Lord make you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also [do] toward you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; 
3:13 to the end he may establish your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints. Amen.
4:1 Finally then, brothers, we urge and exhort you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the Lord Jesus, that, as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> received of us how you<sup><small>+</small></sup> ought to walk and to please God, even as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do walk, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> abound more and more. 
4:2 For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know what charge we gave you<sup><small>+</small></sup> through the Lord Jesus. 
4:3 For this is the will of God, [even] your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sanctification, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> abstain from fornication; 
4:4 that each of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor, 
4:5 not by immoral sexual passion, even as the Gentiles who don't know God; 
4:6 that no man transgress and take advantage of his brother in this matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you<sup><small>+</small></sup> and testified. 
4:7 For God called us not for impurity, but in sanctification. 
4:8 Therefore he who rejects, rejects not man, but God, who also gives his Holy Spirit to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
4:9 But concerning love of the brothers you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have no need that one write to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> yourselves are taught of God to love one another; 
4:10 for indeed you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, brothers, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> abound more and more; 
4:11 and that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> make it your aim to be quiet, and to participate in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> own [things], and to work with your<sup><small>+</small></sup> own hands, even as we charged you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; 
4:12 that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may walk becomingly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.
4:13 But we would not have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> ignorant, brothers, concerning those who fall asleep; that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not sorrow, even as the rest, who have no hope. 
4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so those also who have fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 
4:15 For this we say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep. 
4:16 For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ will rise first; 
4:17 then we who are alive, who are left, will together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 
4:18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.
5:1 But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have no need that anything be written to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
5:2 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. 
5:3 When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape. 
5:4 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you<sup><small>+</small></sup> as a thief: 
5:5 for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness; 
5:6 so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober. 
5:7 For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunk, are drunk in the night. 
5:8 But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation. 
5:9 For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
5:10 who died for us, that, whether we are awake or asleep, we should live together with him. 
5:11 Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do.
5:12 But we urge you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, brothers, to know those who labor among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and are over you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the Lord, and admonish you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; 
5:13 and to esteem them exceedingly highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves. 
5:14 And we exhort you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be long-suffering toward all. 
5:15 See that none render to anyone evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, both one toward another, and toward all. 
5:16 Rejoice always; 
5:17 pray without ceasing; 
5:18 in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
5:19 Do not quench the Spirit; 
5:20 do not despise prophesyings; 
5:21 but prove all things; hold fast that which is good; 
5:22 abstain from every form of evil.
5:23 And may the God of peace himself sanctify you<sup><small>+</small></sup> wholly; and may your<sup><small>+</small></sup> spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
5:24 Faithful is he who calls you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, who will also do it.
5:25 Brothers, pray also for us.
5:26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 
5:27 I adjure you<sup><small>+</small></sup> by the Lord that this letter be read to all the brothers.
5:28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
