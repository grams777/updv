1:1 The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth; 
1:2 for the truth's sake which stays in us, and it will be with us forever: 
1:3 Grace, mercy, peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
1:4 I rejoice greatly that I have found [certain] of your children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father. 
1:5 And now I urge you, lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. 
1:6 And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> heard from the beginning, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> should walk in it. 
1:7 For many deceivers have gone forth into the world: those who do not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. 
1:8 Look to yourselves, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't lose the things which we have worked for, but that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> receive a full reward. 
1:9 Whoever goes onward and doesn't stay in the teaching of Christ, doesn't have God: he who stays in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son. 
1:10 If anyone comes to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and doesn't bring this teaching, don't receive him into [your<sup><small>+</small></sup>] house, and give him no greeting: 
1:11 for he who gives him greeting shares in his evil works.
1:12 Having many things to write to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I would not [write them] with paper and ink: but I hope to come to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full. 
1:13 The children of your elect sister greet you.
