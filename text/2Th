1:1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ; 
1:2 Grace to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1:3 We are bound to give thanks to God always for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, brothers, even as it is meet, for that your<sup><small>+</small></sup> faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each one of all you<sup><small>+</small></sup> toward one another abounds; 
1:4 so that we ourselves glory in you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the churches of God for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> patience and faith in all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> persecutions and in the afflictions which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> endure; 
1:5 [which is] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God; to the end that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also suffer: 
1:6 since it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to those who afflict you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, 
1:7 and to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire, 
1:8 rendering vengeance to those who do not know God, and to those who do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus: 
1:9 who will pay a penalty of eternal destruction away from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might, 
1:10 when he will come to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at in all those who believed (because our testimony to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> was believed) in that day. 
1:11 To which end we also pray always for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that our God may count you<sup><small>+</small></sup> worthy of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and [every] work of faith, with power; 
1:12 that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2:1 Now we urge you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him; 
2:2 to the end that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are not quickly shaken from your<sup><small>+</small></sup> mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us, as that the day of the Lord is just at hand; 
2:3 let no man beguile you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in any wise: for [it will not be,] except the falling away comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition, 
2:4 he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sits in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God. 
2:5 Don't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> remember, that, when I was yet with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I told you<sup><small>+</small></sup> these things? 
2:6 And now you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know that which restrains, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season. 
2:7 For the mystery of lawlessness does already work: only [there is] one who restrains now, until he is removed. 
2:8 And then will be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nothing by the manifestation of his coming; 
2:9 [even he], whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 
2:10 and with all deceit of unrighteousness for those who perish; because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 
2:11 And for this cause God sends them a working of error, that they should believe a lie: 
2:12 that all who did not believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness, would be judged.
2:13 But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, brothers beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you<sup><small>+</small></sup> from the beginning to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: 
2:14 to which he also called you<sup><small>+</small></sup> through our good news, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2:15 So then, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were taught, whether by word, or by letter of ours.
2:16 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, 
2:17 comfort your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts and establish them in every good work and word.
3:1 Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also [it is] with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; 
3:2 and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all do not have faith. 
3:3 But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and guard you<sup><small>+</small></sup> from the evil [one]. 
3:4 And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> both do and will do the things which we command. 
3:5 And may the Lord direct your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
3:6 Now we command you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us. 
3:7 For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> yourselves know how you<sup><small>+</small></sup> ought to imitate us: for we did not behave ourselves disorderly among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; 
3:8 neither did we eat bread for nothing at any man's hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: 
3:9 not because we don't have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> should imitate us. 
3:10 For even when we were with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, this we commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, If any will not work, neither let him eat. 
3:11 For we hear of some who walk among you<sup><small>+</small></sup> disorderly, who don't work at all, but are busybodies. 
3:12 Now those who are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they work with quietness, and eat their own bread. 
3:13 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, brothers, don't be weary in well-doing. 
3:14 And if any man does not obey our word by this letter, note that man, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not associate with him, to the end that he may be ashamed. 
3:15 And [yet] do not count as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
3:16 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with all of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
3:17 The salutation of me Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write. 
3:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
