1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, 
1:2 to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ [who are] at Colossae: Grace to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> and peace from God our Father.
1:3 We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, 
1:4 having heard of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have toward all the saints, 
1:5 because of the hope which is laid up for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the heavens, of which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> heard before in the word of the truth of the good news, 
1:6 which has come to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing, as [it does] in you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also, since the day you<sup><small>+</small></sup> heard and knew the grace of God in truth; 
1:7 even as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow slave, who is a faithful servant of Christ on your<sup><small>+</small></sup> behalf, 
1:8 who also declared to us your<sup><small>+</small></sup> love in the Spirit.
1:9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard [it], do not cease to pray and make request for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, 
1:10 to walk worthily of the Lord to all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; 
1:11 strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, to all patience and long-suffering with joy; 
1:12 giving thanks to the Father, who made you<sup><small>+</small></sup> meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; 
1:13 who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love; 
1:14 in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins: 
1:15 who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; 
1:16 for in him were all things created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and to him; 
1:17 and he is before all things, and in him all things consist. 
1:18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. 
1:19 For it was the good pleasure [of the Father] that in him should all the fullness dwell; 
1:20 and through him to reconcile all things to himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens. 
1:21 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, being in time past alienated and enemies in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> mind in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> evil works, 
1:22 yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you<sup><small>+</small></sup> holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him: 
1:23 if indeed you<sup><small>+</small></sup> continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the good news which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; of which I Paul was made a servant.
1:24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church; 
1:25 of which I was made a servant, according to the dispensation of God which was given me toward you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, to fulfill the word of God, 
1:26 [even] the mystery which has been hid since the ages and since the generations: but now it has been manifested to his saints, 
1:27 to whom God was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, the hope of glory: 
1:28 whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ; 
1:29 to which I labor also, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.
2:1 For I would have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know how greatly I strive for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; 
2:2 that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, [even] Christ, 
2:3 in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden. 
2:4 This I say, that no one may delude you<sup><small>+</small></sup> with persuasiveness of speech. 
2:5 For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the spirit, joying and seeing your<sup><small>+</small></sup> order, and the steadfastness of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> faith in Christ.
2:6 As therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk in him, 
2:7 rooted and built up in him, and established in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> faith, even as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
2:8 Take heed lest there will be anyone who makes spoil of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ: 
2:9 for in him dwells all the fullness of Deity bodily, 
2:10 and in him you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are made full, who is the head of all principality and power: 
2:11 in whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ; 
2:12 having been buried with him in baptism, in which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. 
2:13 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, being dead in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> trespasses and the uncircumcision of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> flesh, you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, he made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses; 
2:14 having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he has taken it out from between [him and us], nailing it to the cross; 
2:15 having despoiled the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
2:16 Let no man therefore judge you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in meat and in drink, or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day: 
2:17 which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's. 
2:18 Let no man rob you<sup><small>+</small></sup> of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> prize by a voluntary humility and worshiping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has seen, puffed up for nothing by his fleshly mind, 
2:19 and not holding fast the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God.
2:20 If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> subject yourselves to ordinances, 
2:21 Don't handle, nor taste, nor touch 
2:22 (all which things are to perish with the using), after the precepts and doctrines of men? 
2:23 Which things indeed have a show of wisdom in do-it-yourself religion, and humility, and severity to the body; [but are] not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.
3:1 If then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 
3:2 Set your<sup><small>+</small></sup> mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth. 
3:3 For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> died, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> life is hid with Christ in God. 
3:4 When Christ will be manifested, [who is] your<sup><small>+</small></sup> life, then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will also be manifested with him in glory.
3:5 Put to death therefore your<sup><small>+</small></sup> members which are on the earth: fornication, impurity, immoral sexual passion, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry; 
3:6 because of these things the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience: 
3:7 in which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also once walked, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> lived in these things; 
3:8 but now do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> mouth: 
3:9 do not lie one to another; seeing that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have put off the old man with his activities, 
3:10 and have put on the new man, who is being renewed to knowledge after the image of him who created him: 
3:11 where there can't be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all things, and in all.
3:12 Put on therefore, as God's elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, long-suffering; 
3:13 forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, so also [should] you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: 
3:14 and above all these things [put on] love, which is the bond of perfectness. 
3:15 And let the peace of Christ rule in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts, to the which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also were called in one body; and be<sup><small>+</small></sup> thankful. 
3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you<sup><small>+</small></sup> richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms [and] hymns [and] spiritual songs, singing with grace in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts to God. 
3:17 And whatever you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do, in word or in deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
3:18 Wives, be in subjection to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 
3:19 Husbands, love your<sup><small>+</small></sup> wives, and do not be bitter against them. 
3:20 Children, obey your<sup><small>+</small></sup> parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord. 
3:21 Fathers, do not provoke your<sup><small>+</small></sup> children, that they not be discouraged. 
3:22 Slaves, obey in all things those who are your<sup><small>+</small></sup> masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord: 
3:23 whatever you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do, work from the soul, as to the Lord, and not to men; 
3:24 knowing that from the Lord you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will receive the recompense of the inheritance: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> serve as slaves to the Lord Christ. 
3:25 For he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done: and there is no favoritism. 
4:1 Masters, render to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> slaves that which is just and equal; knowing that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also have a Master in heaven.
4:2 Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving; 
4:3 as well praying for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds; 
4:4 that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 
4:5 Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time. 
4:6 Let your<sup><small>+</small></sup> speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may know how you<sup><small>+</small></sup> ought to answer each one. 
4:7 All my affairs Tychicus will make known to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, the beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow slave in the Lord: 
4:8 whom I have sent to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> for this very purpose, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may know our state, and that he may comfort your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts; 
4:9 together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. They will make known to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> all things that [are done] here.
4:10 Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner greets you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> received commandments; if he comes to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, receive him), 
4:11 and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these [are my] only coworkers to the kingdom of God, men who have been a comfort to me. 
4:12 Epaphras, who is one of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, a slave of Christ Jesus, greets you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, always striving for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in his prayers, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God. 
4:13 For I bear him witness, that he has much labor for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis. 
4:14 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
4:15 Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church that is in her house. 
4:16 And when this letter has been read among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also read the letter from Laodicea. 
4:17 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the service which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.
4:18 The salutation of me Paul with my own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
