1:1 These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah across from Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab. 
1:2 It is eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea. 
1:3 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, according to all that Yahweh had given him in commandment to them; 
1:4 after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. 
1:5 Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying, 
1:6 Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have dwelt long enough in this mountain: 
1:7 turn<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and take your<sup><small>+</small></sup> journey, and go<sup><small>+</small></sup> to the hill-country of the Amorites, and to all its neighboring places, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. 
1:8 Look, I have set the land before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.
1:9 And I spoke to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you<sup><small>+</small></sup> myself alone: 
1:10 Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God has multiplied you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and see, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. 
1:11 Yahweh, the God of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers, may he make you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a thousand times as many as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are, and bless you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, as he has promised you<sup><small>+</small></sup>! 
1:12 How can I myself alone bear your<sup><small>+</small></sup> cumbrance, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> burden, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> strife? 
1:13 Take yourselves wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tribes, and I will make them heads over you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
1:14 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken is good [for us] to do. 
1:15 So I took the heads of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tribes. 
1:16 And I charged your<sup><small>+</small></sup> judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your<sup><small>+</small></sup> brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner who is with him. 
1:17 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not show favoritism in judgment; you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will hear the small and the great alike; you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not be intimidated by man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will bring to me, and I will hear it. 
1:18 And I commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup> at that time all the things which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> should do.
1:19 And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. 
1:20 And I said to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have come to the hill-country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us. 
1:21 Look, Yahweh your God has set the land before you: go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you; don't be afraid, neither be dismayed. 
1:22 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came near to me every one of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we will come. 
1:23 And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, one man for every tribe: 
1:24 and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. 
1:25 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.
1:26 Yet you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would not go up, but rebelled against the mouth of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God: 
1:27 and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> murmured in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tents, and said, Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. 
1:28 Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and more numerous than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there. 
1:29 Then I said to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Don't dread, neither be afraid of them. 
1:30 Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God who goes before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, he will fight for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, according to all that he did for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in Egypt before your<sup><small>+</small></sup> eyes, 
1:31 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> went, until you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came to this place. 
1:32 Yet in this thing you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not believe Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, 
1:33 who went before you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the way, to seek you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out a place to pitch your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tents in, in fire by night, to show you<sup><small>+</small></sup> by what way you<sup><small>+</small></sup> should go, and in the cloud by day.
1:34 And Yahweh heard the voice of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> words, and was angry, and swore, saying, 
1:35 Surely not a man of these men of this evil generation will see the good land, which I swore to give to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers, 
1:36 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he will see it; and to him I will give the land that he has trodden on, and to his sons, because he has wholly followed Yahweh. 
1:37 Also Yahweh was angry with me for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sakes, saying, You also will not go in there: 
1:38 Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he will go in there: encourage him; for he will cause Israel to inherit it. 
1:39 Moreover your<sup><small>+</small></sup> little ones, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> said should be a prey, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they will go in there, and to them I will give it, and they will possess it. 
1:40 But as for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> turn, and take your<sup><small>+</small></sup> journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
1:41 Then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> answered and said to me, We have sinned against Yahweh, we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us. And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country. 
1:42 And Yahweh said to me, Say to them, Don't go up, neither fight; for I am not among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; lest you<sup><small>+</small></sup> be struck before your<sup><small>+</small></sup> enemies. 
1:43 So I spoke to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> didn't listen; but you<sup><small>+</small></sup> rebelled against the mouth of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country. 
1:44 And the Amorites, who dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and chased you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, as bees do, and beat you<sup><small>+</small></sup> down in Seir, even to Hormah. 
1:45 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn't listen to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> voice, nor gave ear to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
1:46 So you<sup><small>+</small></sup> remained in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> remained [there].
2:1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we compassed mount Seir many days. 
2:2 And Yahweh spoke to me, saying, 
2:3 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have compassed this mountain long enough: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> turn northward. 
2:4 And you command the people, saying, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are to pass through the border of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> brothers the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> take good heed to yourselves therefore; 
2:5 don't contend with them; for I will not give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession. 
2:6 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will purchase food of them for silver, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may eat; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will also buy water of them for silver, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may drink. 
2:7 For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand; he has known your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years Yahweh your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing. 
2:8 So we passed by from our brothers the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 
2:9 And Yahweh said to me, Don't vex Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot for a possession. 
2:10 (The Emim dwelt in it previously, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim: 
2:11 these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. 
2:12 The Horites also dwelt in Seir previously, but the sons of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.) 
2:13 Now rise up, and get yourselves over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered. 
2:14 And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we had come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them. 
2:15 Moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
2:16 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 
2:17 that Yahweh spoke to me, saying, 
2:18 You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab: 
2:19 and when you come near across from the sons of Ammon, don't vex them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you of the land of the sons of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession. 
2:20 (That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt in it previously; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, 
2:21 a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead; 
2:22 as he did for the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even to this day: 
2:23 and the Avvim, who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.) 
2:24 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> rise up, take your<sup><small>+</small></sup> journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: see, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. 
2:25 This day I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who will hear the report of you, and will tremble, and be in anguish because of you.
2:26 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
2:27 Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left. 
2:28 You will sell me food for silver, that I may eat; and give me water for silver, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet, 
2:29 as the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I will pass over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our God gives us. 
2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as at this day. 
2:31 And Yahweh said to me, Look, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land. 
2:32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. 
2:33 And Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people. 
2:34 And we took all his cities at that time, and completely destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining: 
2:35 only the cattle we took for a prey to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken. 
2:36 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and [from] the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Yahweh our God delivered up all before us: 
2:37 only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not come near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.
3:1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
3:2 And Yahweh said to me, Don't fear him; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you will do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon. 
3:3 So Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we struck him until none was left to him remaining. 
3:4 And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
3:5 All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many. 
3:6 And we completely destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, completely destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. 
3:7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. 
3:8 And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to mount Hermon; 
3:9 ([which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir;) 
3:10 all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
3:11 (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; look, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits the width of it, after the cubit of a man.)
3:12 And this land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is on the gorge of Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites: 
3:13 and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim. 
3:14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, to this day.) 
3:15 And I gave Gilead to Machir. 
3:16 And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border [of it], and to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the sons of Ammon; 
3:17 the Arabah also, and the Jordan and the border [of it], from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
3:18 And I commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup> at that time, saying, Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God has given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this land to possess it: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will pass over armed before your<sup><small>+</small></sup> brothers the sons of Israel, all the men of valor. 
3:19 But your<sup><small>+</small></sup> wives, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> little ones, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> cattle (I know that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have much cattle), will remain in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> cities which I have given you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, 
3:20 until Yahweh gives rest to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> brothers, as to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God gives them beyond the Jordan: then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will return every man to his possession, which I have given you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
3:21 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God has done to these two kings: so will Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over. 
3:22 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not fear them; for Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, it is he who fights for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
3:23 And I implored Yahweh at that time, saying, 
3:24 O Sovereign Yahweh, you have begun to show your slave your greatness, and your strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your mighty acts? 
3:25 Let me go over, I pray you, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. 
3:26 But Yahweh was furious with me for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sakes, and didn't listen to me; and Yahweh said to me, Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter. 
3:27 Get up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and look at it with your eyes: for you will not go over this Jordan. 
3:28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he will go over before this people, and he will cause them to inherit the land which you will see. 
3:29 So we remained in the valley across from Beth-peor.
4:1 And now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, to do them; that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may live, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the God of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers, gives you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
4:2 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not add to the word which I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, neither will you<sup><small>+</small></sup> diminish from it, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may keep the commandments of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God which I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
4:3 Your<sup><small>+</small></sup> eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal-peor; for all the men who followed Baal-peor, Yahweh your God has destroyed them from the midst of you. 
4:4 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who stuck to Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God are alive every one of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day. 
4:5 Look, I have taught you<sup><small>+</small></sup> statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh my God commanded me, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> should do so in the midst of the land where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go in to possess it. 
4:6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your<sup><small>+</small></sup> wisdom and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> understanding in the sight of the peoples, that will hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. 
4:7 For what great nation is there, that has a god so near to them, as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on him? 
4:8 And what great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day?
4:9 Only you be careful and keep your soul diligently, or else you will forget the things which your eyes saw, and they will depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your sons and the sons of your sons; 
4:10 the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their sons. 
4:11 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. 
4:12 And Yahweh spoke to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out of the midst of the fire: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> heard the voice of words, but you<sup><small>+</small></sup> saw no form; [you<sup><small>+</small></sup> heard] only a voice. 
4:13 And he declared to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> his covenant, which he commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone. 
4:14 And Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you<sup><small>+</small></sup> statutes and ordinances, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> might do them in the land where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go over to possess it.
4:15 Therefore take<sup><small>+</small></sup> good heed to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> souls; for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> saw no manner of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in Horeb out of the midst of the fire; 
4:16 or else you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will corrupt yourselves, and make you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 
4:17 the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the heavens, 
4:18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth; 
4:19 or else you will lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, you will be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven. 
4:20 But Yahweh has taken you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and brought you<sup><small>+</small></sup> forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day. 
4:21 Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance: 
4:22 but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will go over, and possess that good land. 
4:23 Take heed to yourselves, or else you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will forget the covenant of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, which he made with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and make a graven image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you. 
4:24 For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.
4:25 When you will beget sons, and sons of sons, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will have been long in the land, and will corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of anything, and will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, to provoke him to anger; 
4:26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will soon completely perish from off the land to where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go over the Jordan to possess it; you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not prolong your<sup><small>+</small></sup> days on it, but will be completely destroyed. 
4:27 And Yahweh will scatter you<sup><small>+</small></sup> among the peoples, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh will lead you<sup><small>+</small></sup> away. 
4:28 And there you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will serve gods, the work of man's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
4:29 But from there you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will seek Yahweh your God, and you will find him, when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
4:30 When you are in tribulation, and all these things come upon you, in the latter days you will return to Yahweh your God, and listen to his voice: 
4:31 for Yahweh your God is a merciful God; he will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them.
4:32 Ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of heaven to the other, whether there has been [any such thing] as this great thing is, or has been heard like it? 
4:33 Did ever a people hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live? 
4:34 Or has any god assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of [another] nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God did for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in Egypt before your<sup><small>+</small></sup> eyes? 
4:35 To you it was shown, that you might know that Yahweh he is God; there is no other besides him. 
4:36 Out of heaven he made you hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and on earth he made you see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire. 
4:37 And because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt; 
4:38 to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as at this day. 
4:39 Know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that Yahweh he is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other. 
4:40 And you will keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your sons after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh your God gives you, forever.
4:41 Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising; 
4:42 that the manslayer might flee there, that slays his fellow man unawares, and didn't hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live: 
4:43 [namely], Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
4:44 And this is the law which Moses set before the sons of Israel: 
4:45 these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt, 
4:46 beyond the Jordan, in the valley across from Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel struck, when they came forth out of Egypt. 
4:47 And they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising; 
4:48 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to mount Sion (the same is Hermon), 
4:49 and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
5:1 And Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> ears this day, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may learn them, and observe to do them. 
5:2 Yahweh our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. 
5:3 Yahweh did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day. 
5:4 Yahweh spoke with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire, 
5:5 (I stood between Yahweh and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> at that time, to show you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the word of Yahweh: for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were afraid because of the fire, and didn't go up into the mount;) saying,
5:6 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves.
5:7 You will have no other gods before me.
5:8 You will not make to you a graven image, [nor] any likeness [of anything] that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 
5:9 you will not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them; for I, Yahweh, your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the sons, and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me; 
5:10 and showing loving-kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
5:11 You will not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain: for Yahweh will not hold him innocent who takes his name in vain.
5:12 Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your God commanded you. 
5:13 Six days you will labor, and do all your work; 
5:14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God: you will not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male slave, nor your female slave, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger who is inside your gates; that your male slave and your female slave may rest as well as you. 
5:15 And you will remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
5:16 Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you; that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you, in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
5:17 You will not kill.
5:18 Neither will you commit adultery.
5:19 Neither will you steal.
5:20 Neither will you bear false witness against your fellow man.
5:21 Neither will you covet your fellow man's wife; neither will you desire your fellow man's house, his field, or his male slave, or his female slave, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your fellow man's.
5:22 These words Yahweh spoke to all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me. 
5:23 And it came to pass, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came near to me, even all the heads of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tribes, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> elders; 
5:24 and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> said, Look, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God does speak with man, and yet he [still] lives. 
5:25 Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of Yahweh our God anymore, then we will die. 
5:26 For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? 
5:27 You go near, and hear all that Yahweh our God will say: and you speak to us all that Yahweh our God will speak to you; and we will hear it, and do it.
5:28 And Yahweh heard the voice of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> words, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> spoke to me; and Yahweh said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you: they have well said all that they have spoken. 
5:29 Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their sons forever! 
5:30 Go say to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> return to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tents. 
5:31 But as for you, you stand here by me, and I will speak to you all [of] the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you will teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it. 
5:32 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will observe to do therefore as Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God has commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 
5:33 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will walk in all the way which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God has commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may live, and that it may be well with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may prolong your<sup><small>+</small></sup> days in the land which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will possess.
6:1 Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God commanded to teach you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> might do them in the land where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go over to possess it; 
6:2 that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged. 
6:3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may increase mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
6:4 Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one: 
6:5 and you will love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. 
6:6 And these words, which I command you this day, will be on your heart; 
6:7 and you will teach them diligently to your sons, and will talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up. 
6:8 And you will bind them for a sign on your hand, and they will be for frontlets between your eyes. 
6:9 And you will write them on the door-posts of your house, and on your gates.
6:10 And it will be, when Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you didn't build, 
6:11 and houses full of all good things, which you didn't fill, and cisterns cut out, which you didn't cut, vineyards and olive trees, which you didn't plant, and you will eat and be full; 
6:12 You be careful not to forget Yahweh, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves. 
6:13 You will fear Yahweh your God; and him you will serve, and will swear by his name. 
6:14 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are round about you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; 
6:15 for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a jealous God; if you do, the anger of Yahweh your God will be kindled against you, and he will destroy you from off the face of the earth.
6:16 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not try Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> tried him in Massah. 
6:17 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you. 
6:18 And you will do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh; that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, 
6:19 to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
6:20 When your son asks you in time to come, saying, What [is the meaning of] the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh our God has commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? 
6:21 Then you will say to your son, We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt: and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand; 
6:22 and Yahweh showed signs and wonders, great and intense, on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes; 
6:23 and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers. 
6:24 And Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day. 
6:25 And it will be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all [of] this commandment before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.
7:1 When Yahweh your God will bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and will cast out many nations before you, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than you; 
7:2 and when Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and you will strike them; then you will completely destroy them: you will make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them; 
7:3 neither will you make marriages with them; your daughter you will not give to his son, nor his daughter will you take to your son. 
7:4 For he will turn away your son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and he will destroy you quickly. 
7:5 But thus you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will deal with them: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and cut down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.
7:6 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God: Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth. 
7:7 Yahweh did not set his love on you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, nor choose you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were more in number than any people; for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were the fewest of all peoples: 
7:8 but because Yahweh loves you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and because he would keep the oath which he swore to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers, has Yahweh brought you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out of the house of slaves, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
7:9 Know therefore that Yahweh your God, he is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving-kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations, 
7:10 and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him who hates him, he will repay him to his face. 
7:11 You will therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command you this day, to do them.
7:12 And it will come to pass, because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> listen to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that Yahweh your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving-kindness which he swore to your fathers: 
7:13 and he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you; he will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your cattle and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you. 
7:14 You will be blessed above all peoples: there will not be male or female barren among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, or among your<sup><small>+</small></sup> cattle. 
7:15 And Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, he will put on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you. 
7:16 And you will consume all the peoples that Yahweh your God will deliver to you; your eye will not pity them: neither will you serve their gods; for that will be a snare to you.
7:17 If you will say in your heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them? 
7:18 You will not be afraid of them: you will well remember what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt; 
7:19 the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your God brought you out: so will Yahweh your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. 
7:20 Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you. 
7:21 You will not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is in the midst of you, a great and awesome God. 
7:22 And Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, or else the beasts of the field will increase on you. 
7:23 But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed. 
7:24 And he will deliver their kings into your hand, and you will make their name to perish from under heaven: no man will be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them. 
7:25 The graven images of their gods you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will burn with fire: you will not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it to you, or else you will be snared in it; for it is disgusting to Yahweh your God. 
7:26 And you will not bring something disgusting into your house, and become a devoted thing like it: you will completely detest it, and you will completely be disgusted by it; for it is a devoted thing.
8:1 All [of] the commandment which I command you this day you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will observe to do, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers. 
8:2 And you will remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or not. 
8:3 And he humbled you, and allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you did not know, neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh does man live. 
8:4 Your raiment didn't wax old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years. 
8:5 And you will consider in your heart, that, as a man chastens his son, so Yahweh your God chastens you. 
8:6 And you will keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. 
8:7 For Yahweh your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills; 
8:8 a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey; 
8:9 a land in which you will eat bread without scarceness, you will not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper. 
8:10 And you will eat and be full, and you will bless Yahweh your God for the good land which he has given you.
8:11 You be careful not to forget Yahweh your God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command you this day: 
8:12 or else, when you have eaten and are full, and have built goodly houses, and dwelt in them; 
8:13 and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; 
8:14 then your heart will be lifted up, and you will forget Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves; 
8:15 who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, [in which were] fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint; 
8:16 who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn't know; that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end. 
8:17 And you might say in your heart, My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth. 
8:18 But you will remember Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as at this day. 
8:19 And it will be, if you will forget Yahweh your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will surely perish. 
8:20 As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, so you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will perish; because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would not listen to the voice of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God.
9:1 Hear, O Israel: you are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to heaven, 
9:2 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard it said, Who can stand before the sons of Anak? 
9:3 Know therefore this day, that Yahweh your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you: so you will drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you. 
9:4 Don't speak in your heart, after that Yahweh your God has thrust them out from before you, saying, For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh does drive them out from before you. 
9:5 Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
9:6 Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn't give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people. 
9:7 Remember, don't you forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt, until you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came to this place, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have been rebellious against Yahweh. 
9:8 Also in Horeb you<sup><small>+</small></sup> provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to destroy you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
9:9 When I went up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Yahweh made with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, then I remained in the mount forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water. 
9:10 And Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words, which Yahweh spoke with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. 
9:11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. 
9:12 And Yahweh said to me, Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people that you have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made themselves a molten image. 
9:13 Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and, look, it is a stiff-necked people: 
9:14 leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they. 
9:15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. 
9:16 And I looked, and saw that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> had sinned against Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God; you<sup><small>+</small></sup> had made yourselves a molten calf: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
9:17 And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your<sup><small>+</small></sup> eyes. 
9:18 And I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water; because of all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sin which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger. 
9:19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which Yahweh was angry against you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to destroy you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. But Yahweh listened to me that time also. 
9:20 And Yahweh was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. 
9:21 And I took your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sin, the calf which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> had made, and burned it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast its dust into the brook that descended out of the mount.
9:22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> provoked Yahweh to wrath. 
9:23 And when Yahweh sent you<sup><small>+</small></sup> from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> rebelled against the mouth of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> didn't believe him, nor listen to his voice. 
9:24 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that he knew you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
9:25 So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
9:26 And I prayed to Yahweh, and said, O Sovereign Yahweh, don't destroy your people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
9:27 Remember your slaves, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; don't look to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin, 
9:28 or else the land from where you brought us out will say, Because Yahweh wasn't able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. 
9:29 Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.
10:1 At that time Yahweh said to me, Cut out for yourself two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me into the mount, and make you an ark of wood. 
10:2 And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke, and you will put them in the ark. 
10:3 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut out two tables of stone like the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand. 
10:4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Yahweh gave them to me. 
10:5 And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me. 
10:6 (And the sons of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son served in the priest's office in his stead. 
10:7 From there they journeyed to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water. 
10:8 At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day. 
10:9 Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your God spoke to him.) 
10:10 And I remained in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Yahweh listened to me that time also; Yahweh would not destroy you. 
10:11 And Yahweh said to me, Arise, take your journey before the people; and they will go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.
10:12 And now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, 
10:13 to keep the commandments of Yahweh, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good? 
10:14 Look, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is in it. 
10:15 Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you<sup><small>+</small></sup> above all peoples, as at this day. 
10:16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart, and don't be stiff-necked anymore. 
10:17 For Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who does not regard persons, nor takes reward. 
10:18 He executes justice for the fatherless and widow, and loves the sojourner, in giving him food and raiment. 
10:19 Love<sup><small>+</small></sup> therefore the sojourner; for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were sojourners in the land of Egypt. 
10:20 You will fear Yahweh your God; him you will serve; and to him you will stick, and by his name you will swear. 
10:21 He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen. 
10:22 Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy souls; and now Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of heaven for multitude.
11:1 Therefore you will love Yahweh your God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, always. 
11:2 And know<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day: for [I speak] not with your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons who haven't known, and who haven't seen the chastisement of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his outstretched arm, 
11:3 and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land; 
11:4 and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day; 
11:5 and what he did to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the wilderness, until you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came to this place; 
11:6 and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel: 
11:7 but your<sup><small>+</small></sup> eyes have seen all the great work of Yahweh which he did.
11:8 Therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will keep all [of] the commandment which I command you this day, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go over to possess it; 
11:9 and that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may prolong your<sup><small>+</small></sup> days in the land, which Yahweh swore to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers to give to them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
11:10 For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came out, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs; 
11:11 but the land, where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, [and] drinks water of the rain of heaven, 
11:12 a land which Yahweh your God cares for: the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.
11:13 And it will come to pass, if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will listen diligently to my commandments which I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day, to love Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, and to serve him with all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart and with all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> soul, 
11:14 that I will give the rain of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, and your new wine, and your oil. 
11:15 And I will give grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be full. 
11:16 Take heed to yourselves, or else your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart will be deceived, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 
11:17 and then the anger of Yahweh will be kindled against you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and then he will shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain, and the land will not yield its fruit; and then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will quickly perish from off the good land which Yahweh gives you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
11:18 Therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will lay up these words of mine in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart and in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> soul; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will bind them for a sign on your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand, and they will be for frontlets between your<sup><small>+</small></sup> eyes. 
11:19 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will teach them to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons, talking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up. 
11:20 And you will write them on the door-posts of your house, and on your gates; 
11:21 that your<sup><small>+</small></sup> days may be multiplied, and the days of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons, in the land which Yahweh swore to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth. 
11:22 For if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will diligently keep all this commandment which I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, to do it, to love Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, to walk in all his ways, and to stick to him; 
11:23 then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves. 
11:24 Every place on which the sole of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> foot will tread will be yours<sup><small>+</small></sup> from the wilderness. And Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea, will be your<sup><small>+</small></sup> border. 
11:25 No man will be able to stand before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God will lay the fear of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> and the dread of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> on all the land that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will tread on, as he has spoken to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
11:26 Look, I set before you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day a blessing and a curse: 
11:27 the blessing, if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will listen to the commandments of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, which I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day; 
11:28 and the curse, if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day, to go after other gods, which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> haven't known. 
11:29 And it will come to pass, when Yahweh your God will bring you into the land where you go to possess it, that you will set the blessing on mount Gerizim, and the curse on mount Ebal. 
11:30 (Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah, across from Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?) 
11:31 For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God gives you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will possess it, and dwell in it. 
11:32 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day.
12:1 These are the statutes and the ordinances which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will observe to do in the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> live on the earth. 
12:2 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will surely destroy all the places where the nations that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree: 
12:3 and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will cut down the graven images of their gods; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will destroy their name out of that place. 
12:4 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not do so to Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God. 
12:5 But to the place which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God will choose out of all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tribes, to put his name there to stay, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will seek, and there you will come; 
12:6 and there you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will bring your<sup><small>+</small></sup> burnt-offerings, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sacrifices, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tithes, and the heave-offering of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> vows, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> freewill-offerings, and the firstborns of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> herd and of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> flock: 
12:7 and there you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will eat before Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will rejoice in all that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> put your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand to, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> households, in which Yahweh your God has blessed you. 
12:8 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes; 
12:9 for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Yahweh your God gives you. 
12:10 But when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God causes you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to inherit, and he gives you<sup><small>+</small></sup> rest from all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> enemies round about, so that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> dwell in safety; 
12:11 then it will come to pass that to the place which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God will choose to make his name stay there, there you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will bring all that I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: your<sup><small>+</small></sup> burnt-offerings, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sacrifices, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tithes, and the heave-offering of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand, and all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> choice vows which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> vow to Yahweh. 
12:12 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will rejoice before Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> daughters, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> male slaves, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> female slaves, and the Levite who is inside your<sup><small>+</small></sup> gates, since he has no portion nor inheritance with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
12:13 You be careful not to offer your burnt-offerings in every place that you see; 
12:14 but in the place which Yahweh will choose in one of your tribes, there you will offer your burnt-offerings, and there you will do all that I command you.
12:15 Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat flesh inside all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart. 
12:16 Only you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not eat the blood; you will pour it out on the earth as water. 
12:17 You may not eat inside your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborns of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill-offerings, nor the heave-offering of your hand; 
12:18 but you will eat them before Yahweh your God in the place which Yahweh your God will choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male slave, and your female slave, and the Levite who is inside your gates: and you will rejoice before Yahweh your God in all that you put your hand to. 
12:19 You be careful not to forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
12:20 When Yahweh your God will enlarge your border, as he has promised you, and you will say, I will eat flesh, because your soul desires to eat flesh; you may eat flesh, after all the desire of your soul. 
12:21 If the place which Yahweh your God will choose, to put his name there, is too far from you, then you will kill of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat inside your gates, after all the desire of your soul. 
12:22 Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so you will eat of it: the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike. 
12:23 Only be sure that you do not eat the blood: for the blood is the soul; and you will not eat the soul with the flesh. 
12:24 You will not eat it; you will pour it out on the earth as water. 
12:25 You will not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your sons after you, when you will do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh. 
12:26 Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you will take, and go to the place which Yahweh will choose: 
12:27 and you will offer your burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of Yahweh your God; and the blood of your sacrifices will be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God; and you will eat the flesh. 
12:28 Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your sons after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.
12:29 When Yahweh your God will cut off the nations from before you, where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them, and dwell in their land; 
12:30 You be careful not to be ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed from before you; or else you will inquire after their gods, saying, "How do these nations serve their gods? Even so I will do likewise." 
12:31 You will not do so to Yahweh your God: for every disgusting thing to Yahweh, which he hates, they have done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods.
12:32 Whatever thing I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will observe to do: you will not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
13:1 If there arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he gives you a sign or a wonder, 
13:2 and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you haven't known, and let us serve them; 
13:3 you will not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams: for Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God proves you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, to know whether you<sup><small>+</small></sup> love Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God with all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart and with all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> soul. 
13:4 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will walk after Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will serve him, and stick to him. 
13:5 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, will be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, who brought you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of slaves, to draw you aside out of the way which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk in. So you will put away the evil from the midst of you.
13:6 If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your companion, who is as your own soul, entices you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you haven't known, you, nor your fathers; 
13:7 of the gods of the peoples who are round about you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth; 
13:8 you will not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither will your eye pity him, neither will you spare, neither will you conceal him: 
13:9 but you will surely kill him; your hand will be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. 
13:10 And you will stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves. 
13:11 And all Israel will hear, and fear, and will no more do any such wickedness as this in the midst of you.
13:12 If you will hear concerning one of your cities, which Yahweh your God gives you to dwell there, saying, 
13:13 Certain base fellows have gone out from the midst of you, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> haven't known; 
13:14 then you will inquire, and conduct a search, and ask diligently; and see if it is truth, and the thing certain, that such a disgusting thing is wrought in the midst of you, 
13:15 you will surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it completely, and all that is in it and its cattle, with the edge of the sword. 
13:16 And you will gather all the spoil of it into the midst of its street, and will burn with fire the city, and all its spoil every bit, to Yahweh your God: and it will be a heap forever; it will not be built again. 
13:17 And there will stick nothing of the devoted thing to your hand; that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show you mercy, and have compassion on you, and multiply you, as he has sworn to your fathers; 
13:18 when you will listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep all his commandments which I command you this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.
14:1 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are the sons of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your<sup><small>+</small></sup> eyes for the dead. 
14:2 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God, and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
14:3 You will not eat any disgusting thing. 
14:4 These are the beasts which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, 
14:5 the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the antelope, and the chamois. 
14:6 And every beast that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two, [and] chews the cud, among the beasts, that may you<sup><small>+</small></sup> eat. 
14:7 Nevertheless these you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not eat of those that chew the cud, or of those that have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the coney; because they chew the cud but part not the hoof, they are unclean to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
14:8 And the swine, because he parts the hoof but chews not the cud, he is unclean to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: of their flesh you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not eat, and their carcasses you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not touch.
14:9 These you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales may you<sup><small>+</small></sup> eat; 
14:10 and whatever does not have fins and scales you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not eat; it is unclean to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
14:11 Of all clean birds you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may eat. 
14:12 But these are those of which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not eat: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the osprey, 
14:13 and the glede, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind, 
14:14 and every raven after its kind, 
14:15 and the ostrich, and the nighthawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kind, 
14:16 the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl, 
14:17 and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant, 
14:18 and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat. 
14:19 And all winged creeping things are unclean to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: they will not be eaten. 
14:20 Of all clean birds you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may eat.
14:21 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not eat of anything that dies of itself: you may give it to the sojourner who is inside your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner: for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God. You will not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
14:22 You will surely tithe all the increase of your seed, that which comes forth from the field year by year. 
14:23 And you will eat before Yahweh your God, in the place which he will choose to make his name stay there, the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the firstborns of your herd and of your flock; that you may learn to fear Yahweh your God always. 
14:24 And if the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it, because the place is too far from you, which Yahweh your God will choose, to set his name there, when Yahweh your God will bless you; 
14:25 then you will turn it into silver, and bind up the silver in your hand, and will go to the place which Yahweh your God will choose: 
14:26 and you will bestow the silver for whatever your soul desires, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you; and you will eat there before Yahweh your God, and you will rejoice, you and your household. 
14:27 And the Levite who is inside your gates, you will not forsake him; for he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
14:28 At the end of every three year period you will bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year, and will lay it up inside your gates: 
14:29 and the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are inside your gates, will come, and will eat and be satisfied; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.
15:1 At the end of every seven year period you will make a release. 
15:2 And this is the manner of the release: every creditor will release that which he has lent to his fellow man; he will not exact it of his fellow man and his brother; because Yahweh's release has been proclaimed. 
15:3 Of a foreigner you may exact it: but whatever of yours is with your brother your hand will release. 
15:4 Nevertheless there will be no poor with you (for Yahweh will surely bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it); 
15:5 if only you diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all [of] this commandment which I command you this day. 
15:6 For Yahweh your God will bless you, as he promised you: and you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow; and you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.
15:7 If there is with you a poor man, one of your brothers, inside any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God gives you, you will not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother; 
15:8 but you will surely open your hand to him, and will surely lend him sufficient for his need [in that] which he wants. 
15:9 You be careful not to base a thought in your heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and your eye is evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing; and he cries to Yahweh against you, and it is sin to you. 
15:10 You will surely give to him, and your heart will not be grieved when you give to him; because for this thing Yahweh your God will bless you in all your work, and in all that you put your hand to. 
15:11 For the poor will never cease out of the land: therefore I command you, saying, You will surely open your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor, in your land.
15:12 If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you, and serves you six years; then in the seventh year you will let him go free from you. 
15:13 And when you let him go free from you, you will not let him go empty: 
15:14 you will furnish him liberally out of your flock, and out of your threshing-floor, and out of your wine press; as Yahweh your God has blessed you you will give to him. 
15:15 And you will remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you: therefore I command you this thing today. 
15:16 And it will be, if he says to you, I will not go out from you; because he loves you and your house, because he is well with you; 
15:17 then you will take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he will be your slave forever. And also to your female slave you will do likewise. 
15:18 It will not seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you; for to the double of the wages of a hired worker he has served you six years: and Yahweh your God will bless you in all that you do.
15:19 All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock you will sanctify to Yahweh your God: you will do no work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock. 
15:20 You will eat it before Yahweh your God year by year in the place which Yahweh will choose, you and your household. 
15:21 And if it has any blemish, [as if it is] lame or blind, any ill blemish whatever, you will not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God. 
15:22 You will eat it inside your gates: the unclean and the clean [will eat it] alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart. 
15:23 Only you will not eat its blood; you will pour it out on the ground as water.
16:1 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God; for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night. 
16:2 And you will sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Yahweh will choose to make his name stay there. 
16:3 You will eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you will eat unleavened bread with it, even the bread of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in a hurry: that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life. 
16:4 And there will be no leaven seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither will any of the flesh, which you sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning. 
16:5 You may not sacrifice the Passover inside any of your gates, which Yahweh your God gives you; 
16:6 but at the place which Yahweh your God will choose to make his name stay there, you will sacrifice the Passover at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came forth out of Egypt. 
16:7 And you will roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God will choose: and you will turn in the morning, and go to your tents. 
16:8 Six days you will eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day will be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God; you will do no work [in it].
16:9 Seven weeks you will number to yourself: from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you will begin to number seven weeks. 
16:10 And you will keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill-offering of your hand, which you will give, according as Yahweh your God blesses you: 
16:11 and you will rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male slave, and your female slave, and the Levite who is inside your gates, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are in the midst of you, in the place which Yahweh your God will choose to make his name stay there. 
16:12 And you will remember that you were a slave in Egypt: and you will observe and do these statutes.
16:13 You will keep the feast of tabernacles seven days, after you have gathered in from your threshing-floor and from your wine press: 
16:14 and you will rejoice in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male slave, and your female slave, and the Levite, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are inside your gates. 
16:15 Seven days you will keep a feast to Yahweh your God in the place which Yahweh will choose; because Yahweh your God will bless you in all your increase, and in all the work of your hands, and you will be altogether joyful. 
16:16 Three times in a year will all your males appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he will choose: in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles; and they will not appear before Yahweh empty: 
16:17 every man will give as he is able, according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has given you.
16:18 Judges and officers you will make for yourself in all your gates, which Yahweh your God gives you, according to your tribes; and they will judge the people with righteous judgment. 
16:19 You will not wrest justice: you will not show favoritism; neither will you take a bribe; for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise, and perverts the words of the righteous. 
16:20 That which is altogether just you will follow, that you may live, and inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
16:21 You will not plant for yourself any kind of Asherah pole beside the altar of Yahweh your God, which you will make for yourself. 
16:22 Neither will you set up for yourself a pillar; which Yahweh your God hates.
17:1 You will not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox, or a sheep, in which is a blemish, [or] anything evil; for that is disgusting to Yahweh your God.
17:2 If there is found in the midst of you, inside any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you, man or woman, that does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, in transgressing his covenant, 
17:3 and has gone and served other gods, and worshiped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I haven't commanded; 
17:4 and it is told to you, and you have heard of it, then you will inquire diligently; and see if it is true, and the thing certain, that such a disgusting thing is wrought in Israel, 
17:5 then you will bring forth that man or that woman, who has done this evil thing, to your gates, even the man or the woman; and you will stone them to death with stones. 
17:6 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, he who is to die will be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he will not be put to death. 
17:7 The hand of the witnesses will be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you will put away the evil from the midst of you.
17:8 If there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy inside your gates; then you will arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh your God will choose; 
17:9 and you will come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge that will be in those days: and you will inquire; and they will show you the sentence of judgment. 
17:10 And you will do according to the tenor of the sentence which they will show you from that place which Yahweh will choose; and you will observe to do according to all that they will teach you: 
17:11 according to the tenor of the law which they will teach you, and according to the judgment which they will tell you, you will do; you will not turn aside from the sentence which they will show you, to the right hand, nor to the left. 
17:12 And the man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God, or to the judge, even that man will die: and you will put away the evil from Israel. 
17:13 And all the people will hear, and fear, and no more do presumptuously.
17:14 When you have come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and will possess it, and will dwell in it, and will say, I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are round about me; 
17:15 you will surely set him king over you, whom Yahweh your God will choose: one from among your brothers you will set king over you; you may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother. 
17:16 Only he will not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; since Yahweh has said to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will from now on return no more that way. 
17:17 Neither will he multiply wives to himself, that his heart will not turn away: neither will he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
17:18 And it will be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he will write himself a copy of this law in a book, out of [that which is] before the priests the Levites: 
17:19 and it will be with him, and he will read in it all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them; 
17:20 that his heart is not lifted up above his brothers, and that he does not turn aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his sons, in the midst of Israel.
18:1 The priests the Levites, [even] all the tribe of Levi, will have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: they will eat the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and his inheritance. 
18:2 And they will have no inheritance among their brothers: Yahweh is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them. 
18:3 And this will be the priests' due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it is ox or sheep, that they will give to the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw. 
18:4 The first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, you will give to him. 
18:5 For Yahweh your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in the name of Yahweh, him and his sons forever.
18:6 And if a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel, where he sojourns, and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh will choose; 
18:7 then he will minister in the name of Yahweh his God, as all his brothers the Levites do, who stand there before Yahweh. 
18:8 They will have like portions to eat, besides that which comes of the sale of his patrimony. 
18:9 When you come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you, you will not learn to follow the disgusting behaviors of those nations. 
18:10 There will not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one telling the future, one interpreting omens, or one who uses magic, or a sorcerer, 
18:11 or one casting spells, or one requesting a spirit, or a wizard, or one inquiring of the dead. 
18:12 For whoever does these things is disgusting to Yahweh: and because of these disgusting things Yahweh your God drives them out from before you. 
18:13 You will be perfect with Yahweh your God. 
18:14 For these nations that you will dispossess, listen to psychics and fortune-tellers; but as for you, Yahweh your God has not allowed you to do so.
18:15 Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst of you, of your brothers, like me; to him you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will listen; 
18:16 according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Don't let me hear again the voice of Yahweh my God, neither let me see this great fire anymore, that I will not die. 
18:17 And Yahweh said to me, They have said well that which they have spoken. 
18:18 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers, like you; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he will speak to them all that I will command him. 
18:19 And it will come to pass, that whoever will not listen to my words which he will speak in my name, I will require it of him.
18:20 But the prophet, that will speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I haven't commanded him to speak, or that will speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet will die. 
18:21 And if you say in your heart, How shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken? 
18:22 When a prophet speaks in the name of Yahweh, if the thing does not follow, nor come to pass, that is the thing which Yahweh has not spoken: the prophet has spoken it presumptuously, you will not be afraid of him.
19:1 When Yahweh your God will cut off the nations, whose land Yahweh your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses; 
19:2 you will set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land, which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it. 
19:3 You will prepare for yourself the way, and divide the borders of your land, which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee there.
19:4 And this is the case of the manslayer, who will flee there and live: whoever kills his fellow man unawares, and did not hate him in time past; 
19:5 as when a man goes into the forest with his fellow man to cut wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle, and hits his fellow man, so that he dies; he will flee to one of these cities and live: 
19:6 or else if the avenger of blood pursues the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtakes him, because the way is long, and strikes him in the soul; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he did not hate him in time past. 
19:7 Therefore I command you, saying, You will set apart three cities for yourself. 
19:8 And if Yahweh your God enlarges your border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers; 
19:9 if you will keep all [of] this commandment to do it, which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to walk ever in his ways; then you will add three more cities for yourself, besides these three: 
19:10 that innocent blood will not be shed in the midst of your land, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, and so blood will be on you.
19:11 But if any man hates his fellow man, and lies in wait for him, and rises up against him, and strikes him in the soul so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities; 
19:12 then the elders of his city will send and fetch him from there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. 
19:13 Your eye will not pity him, but you will put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.
19:14 You will not remove your fellow man's landmark, which they of old time have set, in your inheritance which you will inherit, in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.
19:15 One witness will not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, will a matter be established. 
19:16 If an unrighteous witness rises up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing, 
19:17 then both the men, between whom the controversy is, will stand before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges that will be in those days; 
19:18 and the judges will make diligent inquisition: and see if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother; 
19:19 then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will do to him, as he had thought to do to his brother: so you will put away the evil from the midst of you. 
19:20 And those who remain will hear, and fear, and will from now on commit no more of any such evil in the midst of you. 
19:21 And your eyes will not pity; soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
20:1 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and see horses, and chariots, [and] a people more than you, you will not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. 
20:2 And it will be, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> draw near to the battle, that the priest will approach and speak to the people, 
20:3 and will say to them, Hear, O Israel, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> draw near this day to battle against your<sup><small>+</small></sup> enemies: don't let your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart faint; don't fear, nor tremble, neither be<sup><small>+</small></sup> afraid of them; 
20:4 for Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God is he who goes with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, to fight for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> against your<sup><small>+</small></sup> enemies, to save you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
20:5 And the officers will speak to the people, saying, What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, or else if he dies in the battle, another will man dedicate it. 
20:6 And what man is there that has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, or else if he dies in the battle, another man will use its fruit. 
20:7 And what man is there that has betrothed a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, or else if he dies in the battle, another man will take her. 
20:8 And the officers will speak further to the people, and they will say, What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest his brothers' heart melt as his heart. 
20:9 And it will be, when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people, that they will appoint captains of hosts at the head of the people.
20:10 When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it. 
20:11 And it will be, if it answers peace to you, and opens to you, then it will be, that all the people who are found in it will become slave labor to you, and will serve you. 
20:12 And if it will not make peace with you, but will make war against you, then you will besiege it: 
20:13 and when Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand, you will strike every male of it with the edge of the sword: 
20:14 but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all its spoil, you will take for a prey to yourself; and you will eat the spoil of your enemies, which Yahweh your God has given you. 
20:15 Thus you will do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations. 
20:16 But of the cities of these peoples, that Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, you will save alive nothing that breathes; 
20:17 but you will completely destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Yahweh your God has commanded you; 
20:18 that they don't teach you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to follow all their disgusting behaviors, which they have done to their gods; so you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would sin against Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God.
20:19 When you will besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you will not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them; for you may eat of them, and you will not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of you? 
20:20 Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food, you will destroy and cut them down; and you will build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.
21:1 If one is found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it, lying in the field, and it is not known who has struck him; 
21:2 then your elders and your judges will come forth, and they will measure to the cities which are round about him who is slain: 
21:3 and it will be, that the city which is nearest to the slain man, even the elders of that city will take a heifer of the herd, which has not been wrought with, and which has not drawn in the yoke; 
21:4 and the elders of that city will bring down the heifer to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and will break the heifer's neck there in the valley. 
21:5 And the priests, the sons of Levi, will come near; for Yahweh your God has chosen them to minister to him, and to bless in the name of Yahweh; and according to their mouth will every controversy and every stroke be. 
21:6 And all the elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man, will wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley; 
21:7 and they will answer and say, Our hands haven't shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. 
21:8 Forgive, O Yahweh, your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and don't allow innocent blood [to remain] in the midst of your people Israel. And the blood will be forgiven them. 
21:9 So you will put away the innocent blood from the midst of you, when you will do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.
21:10 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your God delivers them into your hands, and you carry them away captive, 
21:11 and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have a desire to her, and would take her to you as wife; 
21:12 then you will bring her home to your house; and she will shave her head, and pare her nails; 
21:13 and she will put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and will remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that you will go in to her, and be her husband, and she will be your wife. 
21:14 And it will be, if you have no delight in her, then you will let her go according to her soul; but you will not sell her at all for silver, you will not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her.
21:15 If a man has two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him sons, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son is hers who was hated; 
21:16 then it will be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn: 
21:17 but he will acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.
21:18 If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not listen to them; 
21:19 then his father and his mother will lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place; 
21:20 and they will say to the elders of his city, This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. 
21:21 And all the men of his city will stone him to death with stones: so you will put away the evil from the midst of you; and all Israel will hear, and fear.
21:22 And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree; 
21:23 his body will not remain all night on the tree, but you will surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of God; that you do not defile your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.
22:1 You will not see your brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them: you will surely bring them again to your brother. 
22:2 And if your brother is not near to you, or if you don't know him, then you will bring it home to your house, and it will be with you until your brother seeks after it, and you will restore it to him. 
22:3 And so you will do with his donkey; and so you will do with his garment; and so you will do with every lost thing of your brother's, which he has lost, and you have found: you may not hide yourself. 
22:4 You will not see your brother's donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them: you will surely help him to lift them up again.
22:5 A woman will not wear that which pertains to a man, neither will a man put on a woman's garment; for whoever does these things is disgusting to Yahweh your God.
22:6 If a bird's nest chance to be before you in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you will not take the dam with the young: 
22:7 you will surely let the dam go, but the young you may take to yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days.
22:8 When you build a new house, then you will make a battlement for your roof, that you do not bring blood on your house, if any man falls from there.
22:9 You will not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, or else the whole fruit will be forfeited, the seed which you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard. 
22:10 You will not plow with an ox and a donkey together. 
22:11 You will not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together.
22:12 You will make yourself fringes on the four borders of your vesture, with which you cover yourself.
22:13 If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and hates her, 
22:14 and lays shameful things to her charge, and brings up an evil name on her, and says, I took this woman, and when I came near to her, I didn't find in her the tokens of virginity; 
22:15 then will the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate; 
22:16 and the damsel's father will say to the elders, I gave my daughter to this man as wife, and he hates her; 
22:17 and, look, he has laid shameful things [to her charge], saying, I didn't find in your daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they will spread the garment before the elders of the city. 
22:18 And the elders of that city will take the man and chastise him; 
22:19 and they will fine him a hundred [shekels] of silver, and give them to the father of the damsel, because he has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel: and she will be his wife; he may not put her away all his days. 
22:20 But if this thing is true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel; 
22:21 then they will bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city will stone her to death with stones, because she has wrought folly in Israel, by prostituting in her father's house: so you will put away the evil from the midst of you.
22:22 If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they will die, both of them, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman: so you will put away the evil from Israel.
22:23 If there is a damsel who is a virgin betrothed to a husband, and a man finds her in the city, and lies with her; 
22:24 then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will stone them to death with stones; the damsel, because she didn't cry, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his fellow man's wife: so you will put away the evil from the midst of you.
22:25 But if the man finds the damsel who is betrothed in the field, and the man forces her, and lies with her; then only the man who lays with her will die: 
22:26 but to the damsel you will do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man rises against his fellow man, and slays him in the soul, even so is this matter; 
22:27 for he found her in the field, the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.
22:28 If a man finds a damsel who is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and lays hold on her, and lies with her, and they are found; 
22:29 then the man who lays with her will give to the damsel's father fifty [shekels] of silver, and she will be his wife, because he has humbled her; he may not put her away all his days.
22:30 A man will not take his father's wife, and will not uncover his father's skirt.
23:1 He who is castrated, or has his penis cut off, will not enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
23:2 A bastard will not enter into the assembly of Yahweh; even to the tenth generation will none of his enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
23:3 An Ammonite or a Moabite will not enter into the assembly of Yahweh; even to the tenth generation will none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Yahweh forever: 
23:4 because they did not meet you<sup><small>+</small></sup> with bread and with water in the way, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you. 
23:5 Nevertheless Yahweh your God would not listen to Balaam; but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing to you, because Yahweh your God loved you. 
23:6 You will not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever.
23:7 You will not be disgusted by an Edomite; for he is your brother: you will not be disgusted by an Egyptian, because you were a sojourner in his land. 
23:8 The sons of the third generation who are born to them will enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
23:9 When you go forth in camp against your enemies, then you will keep yourself from every evil thing. 
23:10 If there is among you<sup><small>+</small></sup> any man, who is not clean by reason of that which chances him by night, then he will go abroad out of the camp, he will not come inside the camp: 
23:11 but it will be, when evening comes on, he will bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he will come inside the camp. 
23:12 You will have a place also outside the camp, where you will go forth abroad: 
23:13 and you will have a stick among your weapons; and it will be, when you sit down abroad, you will dig with it, and will turn back and cover that which comes from you: 
23:14 for Yahweh your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you; therefore will your camp be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.
23:15 You will not deliver to his master a slave who escapes from his master to you: 
23:16 he will dwell with you, in the midst of you, in the place which he will choose inside one of your gates, where it pleases him best: you will not oppress him.
23:17 There will be no lesbian among the daughters of Israel, neither will there be a homosexual among the sons of Israel. 
23:18 You will not bring the wages of a female prostitute, or the wages of a homosexual prostitute, into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow: for even both these are disgusting to Yahweh your God. 
23:19 You will not lend on interest to your brother; interest of silver, interest of victuals, interest of anything that is lent on interest: 
23:20 to a foreigner you may lend on interest; but to your brother you will not lend on interest, that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you go in to possess it.
23:21 When you will vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you will not be slack to pay it: for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you. 
23:22 But if you will forbear to vow, it will be no sin in you. 
23:23 That which has gone out of your lips you will observe and do; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God, a freewill-offering, which you have promised with your mouth.
23:24 When you come into your fellow man's vineyard, then you may eat your fill of grapes according to the pleasure of your soul; but you will not put any in your vessel. 
23:25 When you come into your fellow man's standing grain, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you will not move a sickle to your fellow man's standing grain.
24:1 When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it will be, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly thing in her, that he will write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house. 
24:2 And when she has departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's [wife]. 
24:3 And if the latter husband hates her, and writes her a bill of divorce, and gives it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the latter husband dies, who took her to be his wife; 
24:4 her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she's defiled; for that is disgusting before Yahweh: and you will not cause the land to sin, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.
24:5 When a man takes a new wife, he will not go out in the host, neither will he be charged with any business: he will be free at home one year, and will cheer his wife whom he has taken.
24:6 No man will take the mill or the upper millstone for a pledge; for he takes a soul for a pledge.
24:7 If a man is found stealing a soul of his brothers of the sons of Israel, and he deals with him as a slave, or sells him; then that thief will die: so you will put away the evil from the midst of you.
24:8 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites will teach you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: as I commanded them, so you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will observe to do. 
24:9 Remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam, by the way as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came forth out of Egypt.
24:10 When you lend your fellow man any manner of loan, you will not go into his house to fetch his pledge. 
24:11 You will stand outside, and the man to whom you lend will bring forth the pledge outside to you. 
24:12 And if he is a poor man, you will not sleep with his pledge; 
24:13 you will surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you: and it will be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God.
24:14 You will not oppress a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether he is of your brothers, or of your sojourners who are in your land inside your gates: 
24:15 in his day you will give him his wages, neither will the sun go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his soul on it: lest he cry against you to Yahweh, and it is sin to you.
24:16 The fathers will not be put to death for the sons, neither will the sons be put to death for the fathers: every man will be put to death for his own sin.
24:17 You will not wrest the justice [due] to the fatherless sojourner, nor take the widow's raiment for a pledge; 
24:18 but you will remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you from there: therefore I command you to do this thing.
24:19 When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgot a sheaf in the field, you will not go again to fetch it: it will be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. 
24:20 When you beat your olive tree, you will not go over the boughs again: it will be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow. 
24:21 When you gather [the grapes of] your vineyard, you will not glean it after you: it will be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow. 
24:22 And you will remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt: therefore I command you to do this thing.
25:1 If there is a controversy between men, and they come to judgment, and [the judges] judge them; then they will justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked; 
25:2 and it will be, if the wicked man is worthy to be beaten, that the judge will cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his wickedness, by number. 
25:3 Forty stripes he may give him, he will not exceed; or else, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile to you.
25:4 You will not muzzle the ox when he treads out [the grain].
25:5 If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies, and has no son, the wife of the dead will not be married outside to a stranger: her husband's brother will go in to her, and take her to him as wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her. 
25:6 And it will be, that the firstborn that she bears will succeed in the name of his brother who is dead, that his name will not be blotted out of Israel. 
25:7 And if the man does not want to take his brother's wife, then his brother's wife will go up to the gate to the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuses to raise up to his brother a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband's brother to me. 
25:8 Then the elders of his city will call him, and speak to him: and if he stands, and says, I don't want to take her; 
25:9 then his brother's wife will come to him in the presence of the elders, and loose his sandal from off his foot, and spit in his face; and she will answer and say, So it will be done to the man who does not build up his brother's house. 
25:10 And his name will be called in Israel, The house of him who has his sandal loosed.
25:11 When men strive together, a man and his brother, and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him, and puts forth her hand, and takes him by the genitals; 
25:12 then you will cut off her hand, your eye will have no pity.
25:13 You will not have in your bag diverse weights, a great and a small. 
25:14 You will not have in your house diverse measures, a great and a small. 
25:15 A perfect and just weight you will have; a perfect and just measure you will have: that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you. 
25:16 For all who do such things, [even] all who do unrighteously, are disgusting to Yahweh your God.
25:17 Remember what Amalek did to you by the way as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came forth out of Egypt; 
25:18 how he met you by the way, and struck the hindmost of you, all who were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary; and he didn't fear God. 
25:19 Therefore it will be, when Yahweh your God has given you rest from all your enemies round about, in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it, that you will blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; you will not forget.
26:1 And it will be, when you come in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, and possess it, and dwell in it, 
26:2 that you will take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you will bring in from your land that Yahweh your God gives you; and you will put it in a basket, and will go to the place which Yahweh your God will choose to make his name stay there. 
26:3 And you will come to the priest who will be in those days, and say to him, I profess this day to Yahweh your God, that I have come to the land which Yahweh swore to our fathers to give us. 
26:4 And the priest will take the basket out of your hand, and set it down before the altar of Yahweh your God. 
26:5 And you will answer and say before Yahweh your God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and he became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous. 
26:6 And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid on us hard slavery: 
26:7 and we cried to Yahweh, the God of our fathers, and Yahweh heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression; 
26:8 and Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders; 
26:9 and he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
26:10 And now, look, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which you, O Yahweh, have given me. And you will set it down before Yahweh your God, and worship before Yahweh your God: 
26:11 and you will rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite, and the sojourner who is in the midst of you.
26:12 When you have made an end of tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then you will give it to the Levite, to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat inside your gates, and be filled. 
26:13 And you will say before Yahweh your God, I have put away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, and to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your commandment which you have commanded me: I haven't transgressed any of your commandments, neither have I forgotten them: 
26:14 I haven't eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I put away of it, being unclean, nor given of it for the dead: I have listened to the voice of Yahweh my God; I have done according to all that you have commanded me. 
26:15 Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the ground which you have given us, as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
26:16 This day Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances: you will therefore keep and do them with all your heart, and with all your soul. 
26:17 You have declared Yahweh this day to be your God, and that you would walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and listen to his voice: 
26:18 and Yahweh has declared you this day to be a people for his own possession, as he has promised you, and that you should keep all his commandments; 
26:19 and to make you high above all nations that he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be a holy people to Yahweh your God, as he has spoken.
27:1 And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all [of] the commandment which I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day. 
27:2 And it will be on the day when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will pass over the Jordan to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, that you will set yourself up great stones, and plaster them with plaster: 
27:3 and you will write on them all the words of this law, when you pass over; that you may go in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised you. 
27:4 And it will be, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> pass over the Jordan, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will set up these stones, which I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day, in mount Ebal, and you will plaster them with plaster. 
27:5 And there you will build an altar to Yahweh your God, an altar of stones: you will lift up no iron [tool] on them. 
27:6 You will build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones; and you will offer burnt-offerings on it to Yahweh your God: 
27:7 and you will sacrifice peace-offerings, and will eat there; and you will rejoice before Yahweh your God. 
27:8 And you will write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly.
27:9 And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, Keep silent, and listen, O Israel: this day you have become the people of Yahweh your God. 
27:10 You will therefore obey the voice of Yahweh your God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command you this day.
27:11 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, 
27:12 These will stand on mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> pass over the Jordan: Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin. 
27:13 And these will stand on mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 
27:14 And the Levites will answer, and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice,
27:15 Cursed be the man who makes a graven or molten image, a disgusting thing to Yahweh, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret. And all the people will answer and say, Amen.
27:16 Cursed be he who dishonors his father or his mother. And all the people will say, Amen.
27:17 Cursed be he who removes his fellow man's landmark. And all the people will say, Amen.
27:18 Cursed be he who makes the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people will say, Amen.
27:19 Cursed be he who wrests the justice [due] to the sojourner, fatherless, and widow. And all the people will say, Amen.
27:20 Cursed be he who lies with his father's wife, because he has uncovered his father's skirt. And all the people will say, Amen.
27:21 Cursed be he who lies with any manner of beast. And all the people will say, Amen.
27:22 Cursed be he who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people will say, Amen.
27:23 Cursed be he who lies with his mother-in-law. And all the people will say, Amen.
27:24 Cursed be he who strikes his fellow man in secret. And all the people will say, Amen.
27:25 Cursed be he who takes a bribe to strike the soul of innocent blood. And all the people will say, Amen.
27:26 Cursed be he who does not confirm the words of this law to do them. And all the people will say, Amen.
28:1 And it will come to pass, if you will listen diligently to the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all his commandments which I command you this day, that Yahweh your God will set you on high above all the nations of the earth: 
28:2 and all these blessings will come upon you, and overtake you, if you will listen to the voice of Yahweh your God. 
28:3 Blessed you will be in the city, and blessed you will be in the field. 
28:4 Blessed will be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground, and the fruit of your beasts, the increase of your cattle, and the young of your flock. 
28:5 Blessed will be your basket and your kneading-trough. 
28:6 Blessed you will be when you come in, and blessed you will be when you go out.
28:7 Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you: they will come out against you one way, and will flee before you seven ways. 
28:8 Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns, and in all that you put your hand to; and he will bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you. 
28:9 Yahweh will establish you for a holy people to himself, as he has sworn to you; if you will keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, and walk in his ways. 
28:10 And all the peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of Yahweh; and they will be afraid of you. 
28:11 And Yahweh will make you plenteous for good, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give you. 
28:12 Yahweh will open to you his good treasure the heavens, to give the rain of your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand: and you will lend to many nations, and you will not borrow. 
28:13 And Yahweh will make you the head, and not the tail; and you will be above only, and you will not be beneath; if you will listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I command you this day, to observe and to do [them], 
28:14 and will not turn aside from any of the words which I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
28:15 But it will come to pass, if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day, that all these curses will come upon you, and overtake you. 
28:16 Cursed you will be in the city, and cursed you will be in the field. 
28:17 Cursed will be your basket and your kneading-trough. 
28:18 Cursed will be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground, the increase of your cattle, and the young of your flock. 
28:19 Cursed you will be when you come in, and cursed you will be when you go out.
28:20 Yahweh will send on you cursing, discomfiture, and rebuke, in all that you put your hand to to do, until you are destroyed, and until you perish quickly; because of the evil of your doings, by which you have forsaken me. 
28:21 Yahweh will make the pestilence stick to you, until he has consumed you from off the land, where you go in to possess it. 
28:22 Yahweh will strike you with consumption, and with fever, and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with drought, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they will pursue you until you perish. 
28:23 And your heaven that is over your head will be bronze, and the earth that is under you will be iron. 
28:24 Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust: from heaven it will come down on you, until you are destroyed.
28:25 Yahweh will cause you to be struck before your enemies; you will go out one way against them, and will flee seven ways before them: and you will be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth. 
28:26 And your dead body will be food to all birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the earth; and there will be none to frighten them away. 
28:27 Yahweh will strike you with the boil of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scurvy, and with the itch, of which you can't be healed. 
28:28 Yahweh will strike you with madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart; 
28:29 and you will grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you will not prosper in your ways: and you will be only oppressed and robbed always, and there will be none to save you. 
28:30 You will betroth a wife, and another man will rape her: you will build a house, and you will not dwell in it: you will plant a vineyard, and will not use its fruit. 
28:31 Your ox will be slain before your eyes, and you will not eat of it: your donkey will be violently taken away from before your face, and will not be restored to you: your sheep will be given to your enemies, and you will have none to save you. 
28:32 Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people; and your eyes will look, and fail with longing for them all the day: and there will be nothing in the power of your hand. 
28:33 The fruit of your ground, and all your labors, will a nation which you don't know eat up; and you will be only oppressed and crushed always; 
28:34 so that you will be insane for the sight of your eyes which you will see. 
28:35 Yahweh will strike you in the knees, and in the legs, with an intense boil, of which you can't be healed, from the sole of your foot to the top of your head.
28:36 Yahweh will bring you, and your king whom you will set over you, to a nation that you haven't known, you nor your fathers; and there you will serve other gods, wood and stone. 
28:37 And you will become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where Yahweh will lead you away. 
28:38 You will carry much seed out into the field, and will gather little in; for the locust will consume it. 
28:39 You will plant vineyards and dress them, but you will neither drink of the wine, nor gather [the grapes]; for the worm will eat them. 
28:40 You will have olive trees throughout all your borders, but you will not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olive will cast [its fruit]. 
28:41 You will beget sons and daughters, but they will not be yours; for they will go into captivity. 
28:42 All your trees and the fruit of your ground will the locust possess. 
28:43 The sojourner who is in the midst of you will mount up above you higher and higher; and you will come down lower and lower. 
28:44 He will lend to you, and you will not lend to him: he will be the head, and you will be the tail. 
28:45 And all these curses will come upon you, and will pursue you, and overtake you, until you are destroyed; because you didn't harken to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you: 
28:46 and they will be on you for a sign and for a wonder, and on your seed forever.
28:47 Because you didn't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; 
28:48 therefore you will serve your enemies that Yahweh will send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he will put a yoke of iron on your neck, until he destroys you. 
28:49 Yahweh will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies; a nation whose tongue you will not understand; 
28:50 a nation of fierce countenance, that will not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young, 
28:51 and will eat the fruit of your cattle, and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed; that also will not leave you grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of your cattle, or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish. 
28:52 And they will besiege you in all your gates, until your high and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted, throughout all your land; and they will besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land, which Yahweh your God has given you. 
28:53 And you will eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom Yahweh your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies will distress you. 
28:54 The man who is tender among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and very delicate, his eye will be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his sons whom he has remaining; 
28:55 so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his sons whom he will eat, because he has nothing left for himself, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in all your gates. 
28:56 The tender and delicate woman among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye will be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, 
28:57 and toward her young one who comes out from between her feet, and toward her sons whom she will bear; for she will eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in your gates.
28:58 If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, YAHWEH YOUR GOD; 
28:59 then Yahweh will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and intense sicknesses, and of long continuance. 
28:60 And he will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they will stick to you. 
28:61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, Yahweh will bring them on you, until you are destroyed. 
28:62 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be left few in number, whereas you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God. 
28:63 And it will come to pass, that, as Yahweh rejoiced over you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> good, and to multiply you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, so Yahweh will rejoice over you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to cause you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to perish, and to destroy you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it. 
28:64 And Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth; and there you will serve other gods, which you haven't known, you nor your fathers, even wood and stone. 
28:65 And among these nations you will find no ease, and there will be no rest for the sole of your foot: but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul; 
28:66 and your life will hang in doubt before you; and you will fear night and day, and will have no assurance of your life. 
28:67 In the morning you will say, Oh that it were evening! And at evening you will say, Oh that it were morning! For the fear of your heart which you will fear, and for the sight of your eyes which you will see. 
28:68 And Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I said to you, You will see it no more again: and there you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will sell yourselves to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> enemies for male slaves and for female slaves, and no man will buy you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
29:1 These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
29:2 And Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have seen all that Yahweh did before your<sup><small>+</small></sup> eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his slaves, and to all his land; 
29:3 the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders: 
29:4 but Yahweh has not given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day. 
29:5 And I have led you<sup><small>+</small></sup> forty years in the wilderness: your<sup><small>+</small></sup> clothes are not waxed old on you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and your sandals have not waxed old on your feet. 
29:6 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have not eaten bread, neither have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> drank wine or strong drink; that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may know that I am Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God. 
29:7 And when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle, and we struck them: 
29:8 and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites. 
29:9 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may prosper in all that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do.
29:10 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> stand this day all of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> before Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God; your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heads, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tribes, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> elders, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> officers, even all the men of Israel, 
29:11 your<sup><small>+</small></sup> little ones, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> wives, and your sojourner who is in the midst of your camps, from the cutter of your wood to the drawer of your water; 
29:12 that you may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God, and into his oath, which Yahweh your God makes with you this day; 
29:13 that he may establish you this day to himself for a people, and that he may be to you a God, as he spoke to you, and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
29:14 Neither with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> only do I make this covenant and this oath, 
29:15 but with him who stands here with us this day before Yahweh our God, and also with him who is not here with us this day 
29:16 (for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> passed; 
29:17 and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have seen their detestable things, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them); 
29:18 or else if there should be among you<sup><small>+</small></sup> man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from Yahweh our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; and if there should be among you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a root that bears gall and wormwood; 
29:19 and it comes to pass, when he hears the words of this curse, that he blesses himself in his heart, saying, I will have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry. 
29:20 Yahweh will not pardon him, but then the anger of Yahweh and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book will lie on him, and Yahweh will blot out his name from under heaven. 
29:21 And Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.
29:22 And the generation to come, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons who will rise up after you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and the foreigner who will come from a far land, will say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick; 
29:23 [and that] the whole land of it is brimstone, and salt, [and] a burning, [that] it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows in it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 
29:24 even all the nations will say, Why has Yahweh done thus to this land? What [is the meaning of] the heat of this great anger? 
29:25 Then men will say, Because they forsook the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, 
29:26 and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that they did not know, and that he had not given to them: 
29:27 therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against this land, to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book; 
29:28 and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day. 
29:29 The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may do all the words of this law.
30:1 And it will come to pass, when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you will call them to mind among all the nations, where Yahweh your God has driven you, 
30:2 and will return to Yahweh your God, and will obey his voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your sons, with all your heart, and with all your soul; 
30:3 that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the peoples, where Yahweh your God has scattered you. 
30:4 If [any of] your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of heaven, from there Yahweh your God will gather you, and from there he will fetch you: 
30:5 and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you will possess it; and he will do you good, and multiply you above your fathers. 
30:6 And Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live. 
30:7 And Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who persecuted you. 
30:8 And you will return and obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all his commandments which I command you this day. 
30:9 And Yahweh your God will make you plenteous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your ground, for good: for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers; 
30:10 if you will obey the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.
30:11 For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. 
30:12 It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who will go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it? 
30:13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who will go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it? 
30:14 But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.
30:15 See, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil; 
30:16 If you obey the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you this day to love Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, then you will live and multiply, and Yahweh your God will bless you in the land where you go in to possess it. 
30:17 But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but will be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 
30:18 I denounce to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will surely perish; you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not prolong your<sup><small>+</small></sup> days in the land, where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it. 
30:19 I call heaven and earth to witness against you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed; 
30:20 to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to stick to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days; that you may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.
31:1 And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. 
31:2 And he said to them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no longer go out and come in: and Yahweh has said to me, You will not go over this Jordan. 
31:3 Yahweh your God, he will go over before you; he will destroy these nations from before you, and you will dispossess them: [and] Joshua, he will go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken. 
31:4 And Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land; whom he destroyed. 
31:5 And Yahweh will deliver them up before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will do to them according to all [of] the commandment which I have commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
31:6 Be strong and of good courage, don't fear, nor be afraid of them: for Yahweh your God, it is he who goes with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you. 
31:7 And Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage: for you will bring this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you will cause them to inherit it. 
31:8 And Yahweh, it is he who goes before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake you: don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.
31:9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, that bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and to all the elders of Israel. 
31:10 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of [every] seven year period, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, 
31:11 when all Israel has come to see the face of Yahweh your God in the place which he will choose, you will read this law before all Israel in their hearing. 
31:12 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and your sojourner who is inside your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, and observe to do all the words of this law; 
31:13 and that their sons, who haven't known, may hear, and learn to fear Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, as long as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> live in the land where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go over the Jordan to possess it.
31:14 And Yahweh said to Moses, Look, your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting. 
31:15 And Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent. 
31:16 And Yahweh said to Moses, Look, you will sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and prostitute after the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them. 
31:17 Then my anger will be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they will be devoured, and many evils and troubles will come upon them; so that they will say in that day, Haven't these evils come upon us because our God is not among us? 
31:18 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they will have wrought, in that they have turned to other gods. 
31:19 Now therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> write this song for yourselves, and you teach it to the sons of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the sons of Israel. 
31:20 For when I will have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they will have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then they will turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant. 
31:21 And it will come to pass, when many evils and troubles come upon them, that this song will testify before them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I swore. 
31:22 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the sons of Israel. 
31:23 And he [Yahweh] gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for you will bring the sons of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you.
31:24 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 
31:25 that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, saying, 
31:26 Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, that it may be there for a witness against you. 
31:27 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: look, while I am yet alive with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have been rebellious against Yahweh; and how much more after my death? 
31:28 Assemble to me all the elders of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tribes, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
31:29 For I know that after my death you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will completely corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; and evil will befall you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the latter days; because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger through the work of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hands.
31:30 And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.
32:1 Give ear, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> heavens, and I will speak; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth. 
32:2 My doctrine will drop as the rain; My speech will distill as the dew, As the small rain on the tender grass, And as the showers on the herb. 
32:3 For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh: Ascribe<sup><small>+</small></sup> greatness to our God. 
32:4 The Rock, his work is perfect; For all his ways are justice: A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, Just and right is he. 
32:5 They have dealt corruptly with him, [they are] not his sons, [it is] their blemish; [They are] a perverse and crooked generation. 
32:6 Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> thus repay Yahweh, O foolish people and unwise? Isn't he your father who has bought you? He has made you, and established you. 
32:7 Remember the days of old, Consider the years of many generations: Ask your father, and he will show you; Your elders, and they will tell you. 
32:8 When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, When he separated the sons of man, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the sons of God. 
32:9 For Yahweh's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. 
32:10 He found him in a desert land, And in the waste howling wilderness; He surrounded him, he cared for him, He kept him as the apple of his eye. 
32:11 As an eagle that stirs up her nest, That hovers over her young, He spread abroad his wings, he took them, He bore them on his pinions. 
32:12 Yahweh alone led him, And there was no foreign god with him. 
32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he ate the increase of the field; And he made him to suck honey out of the rock, And oil out of the flinty rock; 
32:14 Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the finest of the wheat; And of the blood of the grape you drank wine. 
32:15 Jacob ate and had his fill, Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: You have waxed fat, you have grown thick, you have become sleek; Then he forsook God who made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. 
32:16 They moved him to jealousy with strange [gods]; With disgusting things they provoked him to anger. 
32:17 They sacrificed to demons, [which were] not God, To gods that they did not know, To new [gods] that came up of late, Which your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers did not dread. 
32:18 Of the Rock that begot you you are unmindful, And have forgotten God who gave you birth. 
32:19 And Yahweh saw [it], and abhorred [them] Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters. 
32:20 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be: For they are a very perverse generation, Sons in whom is no faithfulness. 
32:21 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; They have provoked me to anger with their vanities: And I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. 
32:22 For a fire is kindled in my anger, And burns to the lowest Sheol, And devours the earth with its increase, And sets on fire the foundations of the mountains. 
32:23 I will heap evils on them; I will spend my arrows on them: 
32:24 [They will be] wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts I will send on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust. 
32:25 Outside will the sword bereave, And in the chambers terror; [It will destroy] both young man and virgin, The suckling with the man of gray hairs. 
32:26 I said, I would scatter them far, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among common man; 
32:27 Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, Or else their adversaries should judge amiss, And they should say, Our hand is exalted, And Yahweh has not done all this. 
32:28 For they are a nation void of counsel, And there is no understanding in them. 
32:29 Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would consider their latter end! 
32:30 How should one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Except their Rock had sold them, And Yahweh had delivered them up? 
32:31 For their rock is not as our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges. 
32:32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, And of the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter: 
32:33 Their wine is the poison of serpents, And the cruel venom of cobras. 
32:34 Isn't this laid up in store with me, Sealed up among my treasures? 
32:35 For the day of vengeance and recompense will come in time. Their foot will slide, for the day of their calamity is near. And the things that are to come upon them will hurry. 
32:36 For Yahweh will judge his people, And repent himself for his slaves; When he sees that [their] power is gone, And there is none [remaining], shut up or left at large. 
32:37 And he will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge; 
32:38 Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, [And] drank the wine of their drink-offering? Let them rise up and help you<sup><small>+</small></sup> Let them be your<sup><small>+</small></sup> protection. 
32:39 See now that I, even I, am he, And there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; And there is none that can deliver out of my hand. 
32:40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever, 
32:41 If I whet my glittering sword, And my hand takes hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my adversaries, And will recompense those who hate me. 
32:42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood, And my sword will devour flesh; With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the longhaired heads of the enemy. 
32:43 Rejoice with him, [you<sup><small>+</small></sup>] heavens. And bow down before him, all [you<sup><small>+</small></sup>] gods. For he will avenge the blood of his sons, And will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will pay back those who hate him, And will make expiation for the land of his people.
32:44 And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. 
32:45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel; 
32:46 And he said to them, Set your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart to all the words which I testify to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day, which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will command your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons to observe to do, [even] all the words of this law. 
32:47 For it is no vain thing for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; because it is your<sup><small>+</small></sup> life, and through this thing you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will prolong your<sup><small>+</small></sup> days in the land, where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go over the Jordan to possess it.
32:48 And Yahweh spoke to Moses that very same day, saying, 
32:49 Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is across from Jericho; and look at the land of Canaan, which I give to the sons of Israel for a possession; 
32:50 and die in the mount where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people: 
32:51 because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> trespassed against me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not sanctify me in the midst of the sons of Israel. 
32:52 For you will see the land before you; but you will not go there into the land which I give the sons of Israel.
33:1 And this is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death. 
33:2 And he said, Yahweh came from Sinai, And rose from Seir to them; He shined forth from mount Paran, And with him [were some] from the ten thousands of holy ones: At his right hand was a fiery law for them. 
33:3 Yes, he loves the people; All his saints are in your hand: And they sat down at your feet; [Everyone] will receive of your words. 
33:4 Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob. 
33:5 And he was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together.
33:6 Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few.
33:7 And this is [the blessing] of Judah: and he said, Hear, Yahweh, the voice of Judah, And bring him in to his people. With his hands he contended for him; And you will be a help against his adversaries.
33:8 And of Levi he said, Bring to Levi your Thummim, and your Urim to your godly one, Whom you proved at Massah, With whom you strove at the waters of Meribah; 
33:9 Who said of his father, and of his mother, I haven't seen him; Neither did he acknowledge his brothers, Nor knew he his own sons: For they have observed your word, And keep your covenant. 
33:10 They will teach Jacob your ordinances, And Israel your law: They will put incense before you, And whole burnt-offering on your altar. 
33:11 Bless, Yahweh, his substance, And accept the work of his hands: Strike through the loins of those who rise up against him, And of those who hate him, that they may not rise again.
33:12 Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Yahweh will stay in safety. The Most High covers him all the day long, And he stays between his shoulders.
33:13 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of Yahweh be his land, For the precious things of heaven, for the dew, And for the deep that crouches beneath, 
33:14 And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, And for the precious things of the growth of the moons, 
33:15 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, And for the precious things of the everlasting hills, 
33:16 And for the precious things of the earth and the fullness of it, And the goodwill of him who stayed in the bush. Let [the blessing] come upon the head of Joseph, And on the top of the head of him who was separate from his brothers. 
33:17 The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his; And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox: With them he will push the peoples all of them, [even] the ends of the earth: And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, And they are the thousands of Manasseh.
33:18 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; And, Issachar, in your tents. 
33:19 They will call the peoples to the mountain; There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness: For they will suck the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the sand.
33:20 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he who enlarges Gad: Like a lion he stays, And tears the arm, yes, the top of the head. 
33:21 And he provided the first part for himself, For where the lawgiver's portion was, There the chiefs of the people assembled together; He executed the righteousness of Yahweh, And his ordinances with Israel.
33:22 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp, That leaps forth from Bashan.
33:23 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, And full with the blessing of Yahweh, Possess the west and the south.
33:24 And of Asher he said, Blessed be Asher with sons; Let him be acceptable to his brothers, And let him dip his foot in oil. 
33:25 Your bars will be iron and bronze; And as your days, so will your strength be. 
33:26 There is none like God, O Jeshurun, Who rides on the heavens for your help, And in his excellency on the skies. 
33:27 The eternal God is [your] dwelling-place, And underneath are the everlasting arms. And he thrusts out the enemy from before you, And said, Destroy. 
33:28 And Israel stays in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine; Yes, his heavens drop down dew. 
33:29 Happy are you, O Israel: Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh, The shield of your help, And the sword of your excellency! And your enemies will submit themselves to you; And you will tread on their high places.
34:1 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is across from Jericho. And Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan, 
34:2 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea, 
34:3 and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, to Zoar. 
34:4 And Yahweh said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed: I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you will not go over there. 
34:5 So Moses the slave of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, according to the mouth of Yahweh. 
34:6 And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab across from Beth-peor: but no man knows of his tomb to this day. 
34:7 And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. 
34:8 And the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses had ended.
34:9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: and the sons of Israel listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
34:10 And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face, 
34:11 in all the signs and the wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his slaves, and to all his land, 
34:12 and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.
