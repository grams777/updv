1:1 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob): 
1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 
1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 
1:4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 
1:5 And Joseph was in Egypt. And all the souls who came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy-five souls. 
1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation. 
1:7 And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.
1:8 Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn't know Joseph. 
1:9 And he said to his people, Look, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we: 
1:10 come, let's deal wisely with them, or else they will multiply, and it will come to pass, that, when war breaks out, they will also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and get up out of the land. 
1:11 Therefore they set over them slave masters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses. 
1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the sons of Israel. 
1:13 And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel to serve with rigor: 
1:14 and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in bricks, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, in which they made them serve with rigor.
1:15 And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 
1:16 and he said, When you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth-stool; if it is a son, then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she will live. 
1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive. 
1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive? 
1:19 And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered before the midwife comes to them. 
1:20 And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 
1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households. 
1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son who is born you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will cast into the river, and every daughter you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will save alive.
2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took as wife the daughter of Levi. 
2:2 And the woman became pregnant, and gave birth to a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. 
2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child in it, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink. 
2:4 And his sister stood far off, to know what would be done to him. 
2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the riverside; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her female slave to fetch it. 
2:6 And she opened it, and saw the child: and, look, the baby wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. 
2:7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call you a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you? 
2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the young woman went and called the child's mother. 
2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. 
2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she named him Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.
2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers. 
2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he struck the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 
2:13 And he went out the second day, and, look, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him who did the wrong, Why do you strike your fellow man? 
2:14 And he said, Who made you as a man, a prince and a judge over us? Do you think to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known. 
2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and he settled in the land of Midian after having moved to the land of Midian. And [one day] he sat down by a well. 
2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 
2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have come so soon today? 
2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock. 
2:20 And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread. 
2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. 
2:22 And she bore a son, and he named him Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.
2:23 And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the sons of Israel sighed by reason of the slavery, and they cried, and their cry came up to God by reason of the slavery. 
2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
2:25 And God saw the sons of Israel, and God took knowledge [of them].
3:1 Now Moses was shepherding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb. 
3:2 And the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and noticed that the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. 
3:3 And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. 
3:4 And when Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here I am. 
3:5 And he said, Don't come any closer: take off your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground. 
3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God. 
3:7 And Yahweh said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 
3:8 and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a land good and large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
3:9 And now, look, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to me: moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. 
3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people the sons of Israel out of Egypt. 
3:11 And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt? 
3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will serve God on this mountain.
3:13 And Moses said to God, Look, when I come to the sons of Israel, and will say to them, The God of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers has sent me to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; and they will say to me, What is his name? What shall I say to them? 
3:14 And God said to Moses, I AM WHO ALWAYS IS: and he said, Thus you will say to the sons of Israel, I AM has sent me to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
3:15 And God said moreover to Moses, Thus you will say to the sons of Israel, Yahweh, the God of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations. 
3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, Yahweh, the God of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and [seen] that which is done to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in Egypt: 
3:17 and I have said, I will bring you<sup><small>+</small></sup> up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey. 
3:18 And they will listen to your voice: and you will come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will say to him, Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us: and now let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God. 
3:19 And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> leave to go, not even with a mighty hand [of God]. 
3:20 And I will put forth my hand, and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of it: and after that he will let you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go. 
3:21 And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it will come to pass, that, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not go empty. 
3:22 But every woman will ask of her neighbor, and of her who sojourns in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will put them on your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons, and on your<sup><small>+</small></sup> daughters; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will despoil the Egyptians.
4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, look, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, Yahweh has not appeared to you. 
4:2 And Yahweh said to him, What is that in your hand? And he said, A rod. 
4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. 
4:4 And Yahweh said to Moses, Put forth your hand, and take it by the tail: (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand:) 
4:5 That they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you. 
4:6 And Yahweh said furthermore to him, Put now your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, look, his hand was leprous, as [white as] snow. 
4:7 And he said, Put your hand into your bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, look, it was turned again as his [other] flesh.) 
4:8 And it will come to pass, if they will not believe you, neither listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 
4:9 And it will come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither listen to your voice, that you will take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land: and the water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.
4:10 And Moses said to Yahweh, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before, nor since you have spoken to your slave; for I am slow of mouth, and slow of tongue. 
4:11 And Yahweh said to him, Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes [man] mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh? 
4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you will speak. 
4:13 And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray you, by the hand of him whom you will send. 
4:14 And the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, look, he comes forth to meet you: and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. 
4:15 And you will speak to him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you<sup><small>+</small></sup> what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will do. 
4:16 And he will be your spokesman to the people; and it will come to pass, that he will be to you as a mouth, and you will be to him as God. 
4:17 And you will take in your hand this rod, with which you will do the signs.
4:18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray you, and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. 
4:19 And Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought your soul. 
4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. 
4:21 And Yahweh said to Moses, When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand: but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go. 
4:22 And you will say to Pharaoh, Thus says Yahweh, Israel is my son, my firstborn: 
4:23 and I have said to you, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and you have refused to let him go: look, I will slay your son, your firstborn. 
4:24 And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that Yahweh met him, and sought to kill him. 
4:25 Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood you are to me. 
4:26 So he left him alone. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood [you are], because of the circumcision.
4:27 And Yahweh said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mountain of God, and kissed him. 
4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had charged him. 
4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel: 
4:30 and Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. 
4:31 And the people believed: and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the sons of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.
5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness. 
5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don't know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go. 
5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, or else he will fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword. 
5:4 And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Moses and Aaron, take the people away from their works? You<sup><small>+</small></sup> get to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> burdens. 
5:5 And Pharaoh said, Look, the people of the land are now many, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> make them rest from their burdens. 
5:6 And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, 
5:7 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will no more give the people straw to make bricks, as before: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
5:8 And the number of the bricks, which they made before, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will lay on them; you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not diminish anything of it: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. 
5:9 Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor at it; and don't let them regard lying words.
5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I will not give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> straw. 
5:11 Go yourselves, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> get straw where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> can find it: for nothing of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> work will be diminished. 
5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
5:13 And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfill your<sup><small>+</small></sup> works, [your<sup><small>+</small></sup>] daily tasks, as when there was straw. 
5:14 And the officers of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not fulfilled your<sup><small>+</small></sup> task both yesterday and today, in making bricks as before?
5:15 Then the officers of the sons of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why do you deal thus with your slaves? 
5:16 There is no straw given to your slaves, and they say to us, Make bricks: and, look, your slaves are beaten; and your people will be guilty. 
5:17 But he said, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are idle, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are idle: therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh. 
5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there will no straw be given you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, yet you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will deliver the number of bricks. 
5:19 And the officers of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble, when it was said, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not diminish anything from your<sup><small>+</small></sup> bricks, [your<sup><small>+</small></sup>] daily tasks. 
5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 
5:21 and they said to them, Yahweh look at you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and judge: because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have made our savor to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his slaves, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.
5:22 And Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, Lord, why have you dealt ill with this people? Why is it that you have sent me? 
5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has dealt ill with this people; neither have you delivered your people at all. 
6:1 And Yahweh said to Moses, Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand [of God] he will let them go, and with a strong hand [of God] he will drive them out of his land.
6:2 And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am Yahweh: 
6:3 and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them. 
6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, in which they sojourned. 
6:5 And moreover I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in slavery; and I have remembered my covenant. 
6:6 Therefore say to the sons of Israel, I am Yahweh, and I will bring you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out of their slavery, and I will redeem you<sup><small>+</small></sup> with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments: 
6:7 and I will take you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to be my people, and I will be your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will know that I am Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, who brings you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
6:8 And I will bring you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> for a heritage: I am Yahweh. 
6:9 And Moses so spoke to the sons of Israel: but they didn't listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel slavery.
6:10 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
6:11 Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land. 
6:12 And Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, Look, the sons of Israel haven't listened to me; how then will Pharaoh hear me, I who am of uncircumcised lips? 
6:13 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the sons of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
6:14 These are the heads of their fathers' houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben. 
6:15 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman; these are the families of Simeon. 
6:16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years. 
6:17 The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families. 
6:18 And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years. 
6:19 And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. 
6:20 And Amram took himself Jochebed his father's sister as wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years. 
6:21 And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 
6:22 And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri. 
6:23 And Aaron took to himself Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, as wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
6:24 And the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. 
6:25 And Eleazar Aaron's son took himself one of the daughters of Putiel as wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the Levites according to their families. 
6:26 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Yahweh said, Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts. 
6:27 These are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.
6:28 And it came to pass on the day when Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, 
6:29 that Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, I am Yahweh: speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you. 
6:30 And Moses said before Yahweh, Look, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how will Pharaoh listen to me? 
7:1 And Yahweh said to Moses, See, I have made you as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother will be your prophet. 
7:2 You will speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother will speak to Pharaoh, that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land. 
7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 
7:4 But Pharaoh will not listen to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and I will lay my hand on Egypt, and bring forth my hosts, my people the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 
7:5 And Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, when I stretch forth my hand on Egypt, and bring out the sons of Israel from among them. 
7:6 And Moses and Aaron did so; as Yahweh commanded them, so they did. 
7:7 And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
7:8 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
7:9 When Pharaoh speaks to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, saying, Show a wonder for yourselves; then you will say to Aaron, Take your rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it becomes a serpent. 
7:10 And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Yahweh had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his slaves, and it became a serpent. 
7:11 Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers: and the sacred scholars of Egypt also did in like manner with their witchcraft. 
7:12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 
7:13 And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.
7:14 And Yahweh said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuses to let the people go. 
7:15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning; see, he goes out to the water; and you will stand by the river's brink to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you will take in your hand. 
7:16 And you will say to him, Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, look, so far you haven't listened. 
7:17 Thus says Yahweh, In this you will know that I am Yahweh: look, I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river, and they will be turned to blood. 
7:18 And the fish that are in the river will die, and the river will stink; and the Egyptians will loathe to drink water from the river. 
7:19 And Yahweh said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.
7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his slaves; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. 
7:21 And the fish that were in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. 
7:22 And the sacred scholars of Egypt did in like manner with their magic: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken. 
7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart. 
7:24 And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 
7:25 And seven days were fulfilled after Yahweh had struck the river.
8:1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus says Yahweh, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
8:2 And if you refuse to let them go, look, I will strike all your borders with frogs: 
8:3 and the river will swarm with frogs, which will go up and come into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed, and into the house of your slaves, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading-troughs: 
8:4 and the frogs will come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your slaves. 
8:5 And Yahweh said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt. 
8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
8:7 And the sacred scholars did in like manner with their magic, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat Yahweh, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Yahweh. 
8:9 And Moses said to Pharaoh, You have this glory over me: for what time shall I entreat for you, and for your slaves, and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, and remain in the river only? 
8:10 And he said, For tomorrow. And he said, Let it be according to your word; that you may know that there is none like Yahweh our God. 
8:11 And the frogs will depart from you, and from your houses, and from your slaves, and from your people; they will remain in the river only. 
8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried to Yahweh concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh. 
8:13 And Yahweh did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields. 
8:14 And they gathered them together in heaps; and the land stank. 
8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and didn't listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken.
8:16 And Yahweh said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
8:17 And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man and on beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
8:18 And the sacred scholars did so with their magic to bring forth lice, but they could not: and there were lice on man and on beast. 
8:19 Then the sacred scholars said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.
8:20 And Yahweh said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; look, he comes forth to the water; and say to him, Thus says Yahweh, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
8:21 For if you will not let my people go, look, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your slaves, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians will be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they are. 
8:22 And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies will be there; to the end you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst of the earth. 
8:23 And I will put redemption between my people and your people: by tomorrow will this sign be. 
8:24 And Yahweh did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his slaves' houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.
8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go<sup><small>+</small></sup>, sacrifice to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God in the land. 
8:26 And Moses said, It is not right to do so; for we will sacrifice something disgusting of the Egyptians to Yahweh our God: look, if we will sacrifice something disgusting of the Egyptians before their eyes, then will they not stone us? 
8:27 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, as he will command us. 
8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may sacrifice to Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God in the wilderness; only you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not go very far away: entreat for me. 
8:29 And Moses said, Look, I go out from you, and I will entreat Yahweh that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his slaves, and from his people, tomorrow: only don't let Pharaoh deal deceitfully anymore in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Yahweh. 
8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Yahweh. 
8:31 And Yahweh did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his slaves, and from his people; not one remained. 
8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.
9:1 Then Yahweh said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
9:2 For if you refuse to let them go, and will still hold them, 
9:3 look, the hand of Yahweh is on your cattle which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks: [there will be] a very grievous pestilence. 
9:4 And Yahweh will make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and nothing will die of all that belongs to the sons of Israel. 
9:5 And Yahweh appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow Yahweh will do this thing in the land. 
9:6 And Yahweh did that thing on the next day; and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the sons of Israel not one died. 
9:7 And Pharaoh sent and saw that there wasn't so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
9:8 And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to yourselves handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. 
9:9 And it will become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and will be a boil breaking forth with sores on man and on beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. 
9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with sores on man and on beast. 
9:11 And the sacred scholars could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the sacred scholars, and on all the Egyptians. 
9:12 And Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he didn't listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.
9:13 And Yahweh said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
9:14 For this time I will send all my plagues on your heart, and on your slaves, and on your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth. 
9:15 For now I have put forth my hand, and have struck you and your people with pestilence, and you have been cut off from the earth: 
9:16 but in deed for this very cause I have made you to stand, to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. 
9:17 You still exalt yourself against my people, that you will not let them go. 
9:18 Look, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now. 
9:19 Now therefore send, hurry in your cattle and all that you have in the field; [for] all of man and beast that will be found in the field, and will not be brought home, the hail will come down on them, and they will die. 
9:20 He who feared the word of Yahweh among the slaves of Pharaoh made his slaves and his cattle flee into the houses. 
9:21 And he who did not regard the word of Yahweh left his slaves and his cattle in the field.
9:22 And Yahweh said to Moses, Stretch forth your hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. 
9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and Yahweh sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth; and Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt. 
9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
9:25 And the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, from man to beast; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field. 
9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, there was no hail.
9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: Yahweh is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 
9:28 Entreat Yahweh; for there has been enough of [these] mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will wait no longer. 
9:29 And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to Yahweh; the thunders will cease, neither will there be anymore hail; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh's. 
9:30 But as for you and your slaves, I know that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not yet fear Yahweh God. 
9:31 And the flax and the barley were struck: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom. 
9:32 But the wheat and the spelt were not struck: for they were not grown up. 
9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to Yahweh: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth. 
9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his slaves. 
9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, as Yahweh had spoken by Moses.
10:1 And Yahweh said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his slaves, that I may show these signs of mine in his midst, 
10:2 and that you may tell in the ears of your son, and of your son's son, what things I have wrought on Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may know that I am Yahweh. 
10:3 And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
10:4 For if you refuse to let my people go, look, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your border: 
10:5 and they will cover the face of the earth, so that one will not be able to see the earth: and they will eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> from the hail, and will eat every tree which grows for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out of the field: 
10:6 and your houses will be filled, and the houses of all your slaves, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh. 
10:7 And Pharaoh's slaves said to him, How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve Yahweh their God: Don't you know yet that Egypt is destroyed? 
10:8 And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go, serve Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God; but who are those who will go? 
10:9 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds we will go; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh. 
10:10 And he said to them, So be Yahweh with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, as I will let you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> little ones: look to it; for evil is before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
10:11 Not so: now go, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who are [prominent] men, and serve Yahweh; for that is what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> desire. And he had them driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
10:12 And Yahweh said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left. 
10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 
10:14 And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; they were very grievous; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them will be such. 
10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and no green thing remained, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 
10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in a hurry; and he said, I have sinned against Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, and against you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray you, my sin only this once, and entreat Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, that he may take away from me this death only. 
10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Yahweh. 
10:19 And Yahweh turned an exceedingly strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust remained in all the border of Egypt. 
10:20 But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go.
10:21 And Yahweh said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt. 
10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days; 
10:23 they didn't see one another, neither rose anyone from his place for three days: but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings. 
10:24 And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> go, serve Yahweh; only let your<sup><small>+</small></sup> flocks and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> herds be left behind: let your<sup><small>+</small></sup> little ones also go with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
10:25 And Moses said, You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God. 
10:26 Our cattle also will go with us; there will not be a hoof left behind: for we must take of them to serve Yahweh our God; and we don't know with what we must serve Yahweh, until we come there. 
10:27 But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go. 
10:28 And Pharaoh said to him, You get away from me, take heed to yourself, see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you will die. 
10:29 And Moses said, You have spoken well. I will see your face again no more.
11:1 And Yahweh said to Moses, Yet one plague more I will bring on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterward he will let you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go from here: when he will let you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go, he will surely thrust you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out from here altogether. 
11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his fellow man, and every woman of her fellow woman, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold. 
11:3 And Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's slaves, and in the sight of the people.
11:4 And Moses said, Thus says Yahweh, About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt: 
11:5 and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female slave who is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of cattle. 
11:6 And there will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor will be anymore. 
11:7 But against any of the sons of Israel will not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may know how that Yahweh does make a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel. 
11:8 And all these slaves of yours will come down to me, and bow themselves down to me, saying, You get out, and all the people who follow you: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
11:9 And Yahweh said to Moses, Pharaoh will not listen to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 
11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land.
12:1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, 
12:2 This month will be to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the beginning of months: it will be the first month of the year to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
12:3 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth [day] of this month they will take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household: 
12:4 and if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house will take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man's eating you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will make your<sup><small>+</small></sup> count for the lamb. 
12:5 Your<sup><small>+</small></sup> lamb will be without blemish, a male a year old: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will take it from the sheep, or from the goats: 
12:6 and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel will kill it at evening. 
12:7 And they will take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, on the houses in which they will eat it. 
12:8 And they will eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they will eat it. 
12:9 Don't eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs and with its insides. 
12:10 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remains of it until the morning you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will burn with fire. 
12:11 And thus you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will eat it: with your<sup><small>+</small></sup> loins girded, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sandals on your<sup><small>+</small></sup> feet, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> staff in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will eat it in a hurry: it is Yahweh's Passover. 
12:12 For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Yahweh. 
12:13 And the blood will be to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> for a token on the houses where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and there will be no plague on you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to destroy you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, when I strike the land of Egypt. 
12:14 And this day will be to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> for a memorial, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will keep it [as] a feast to Yahweh: throughout your<sup><small>+</small></sup> generations you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will keep it [as] a feast by an ordinance forever.
12:15 Seven days you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will eat unleavened bread; even the first day you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will put away leaven out of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> houses: for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul will be cut off from Israel. 
12:16 And in the first day there will be to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work will be done in them, except that which every soul must eat, only that may be done by you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
12:17 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will observe the [feast of] unleavened bread; for in this very same day I have brought your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will observe this day throughout your<sup><small>+</small></sup> generations by an ordinance forever. 
12:18 In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at evening. 
12:19 Seven days there will be no leaven found in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> houses: for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul will be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a sojourner, or one who is born in the land. 
12:20 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will eat nothing leavened; in all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> habitations you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will eat unleavened bread.
12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> take lambs according to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> families, and kill the Passover. 
12:22 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will go out of the door of his house until the morning. 
12:23 For Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> houses to strike you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
12:24 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever. 
12:25 And it will come to pass, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> come to the land which Yahweh will give you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, according as he has promised, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will keep this service. 
12:26 And it will come to pass, when your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons will say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, What do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> mean by this service? 
12:27 Then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will say, It is the sacrifice of Yahweh's Passover, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped. 
12:28 And the sons of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
12:29 And it came to pass at midnight, that Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. 
12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his slaves, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead. 
12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> get forth from among my people, both you<sup><small>+</small></sup> and the sons of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have said. 
12:32 Take both your<sup><small>+</small></sup> flocks and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> herds, as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have said, and be gone; and bless me also. 
12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent on the people, to send them out of the land in a hurry; for they said, We are all dead men. 
12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders. 
12:35 And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. 
12:36 And Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians.
12:37 And the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were [able-bodied] men, besides children. 
12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very many cattle. 
12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals. 
12:40 Now the time that the sons of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. 
12:41 And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the very same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt. 
12:42 It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of Yahweh, to be much observed of all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.
12:43 And Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the Passover: no foreigner will eat of it; 
12:44 but every man's slave who is bought for silver, when you have circumcised him, then he will eat of it. 
12:45 A sojourner and a hired worker will not eat of it. 
12:46 In one house it will be eaten; you will not carry forth anything of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither will you<sup><small>+</small></sup> break a bone of it. 
12:47 All the congregation of Israel will keep it. 
12:48 And when a stranger sojourns with you, and [before he] keeps the Passover to Yahweh, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he will be as one who is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person will eat of it. 
12:49 One law will be to him who is home-born, and to the stranger who sojourns among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
12:50 Thus did all the sons of Israel; as Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did. 
12:51 And it came to pass the very same day, that Yahweh brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.
13:1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
13:2 Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the sons of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.
13:3 And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came out from Egypt, out of the house of slaves; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out from this place: there will be no leavened bread eaten. 
13:4 This day you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go forth in the month Abib. 
13:5 And it will be, when Yahweh will bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you will keep this service in this month. 
13:6 Seven days you will eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day will be a feast to Yahweh. 
13:7 Unleavened bread will be eaten throughout the seven days; and there will be no leavened bread seen with you, neither will there be leaven seen with you, in all your borders. 
13:8 And you will tell your son in that day, saying, It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came forth out of Egypt. 
13:9 And it will be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth: for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt. 
13:10 You will therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
13:11 And it will be, when Yahweh will bring you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and will give it you, 
13:12 that you will set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb, and every firstborn which you have that comes of a beast; the males will be Yahweh's. 
13:13 And every firstborn of a donkey you will redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you will break its neck: and all the firstborn of man among your sons you will redeem. 
13:14 And it will be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What is this? Then you will say to him, By strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from the house of slaves: 
13:15 and it came to pass, when Pharaoh hardened against letting us go, that Yahweh slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem. 
13:16 And it will be for a sign on your hand, and for frontlets between your eyes: for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt.
13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God didn't lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Or else perhaps the people will repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 
13:18 but God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea: and the sons of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt. 
13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the sons of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will carry up my bones away from here with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 
13:21 And Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night: 
13:22 the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, did not depart from before the people.
14:1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
14:2 Speak to the sons of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon: across from it you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will encamp by the sea. 
14:3 And Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness has shut them in. 
14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will follow after them; and I will get myself honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host: and the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh. And they did so. 
14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his slaves was changed toward the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us? 
14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: 
14:7 and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them. 
14:8 And Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the sons of Israel: for the sons of Israel went out with a high hand. 
14:9 And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses [and] chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.
14:10 And when Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, saw that the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid: and the sons of Israel cried out to Yahweh. 
14:11 And they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt? 
14:12 Isn't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than we should die in the wilderness. 
14:13 And Moses said to the people, Don't be<sup><small>+</small></sup> afraid, stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh, which he will work for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> today: for the Egyptians whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have seen today, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will see them again no more forever. 
14:14 Yahweh will fight for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will hold your<sup><small>+</small></sup> peace.
14:15 And Yahweh said to Moses, Why do you cry to me? Speak to the sons of Israel, that they go forward. 
14:16 And you lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the sons of Israel will go into the midst of the sea on dry ground. 
14:17 And I, look, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will go in after them: and I will get myself honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host, on his chariots, and on his horsemen. 
14:18 And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh, when I have gotten myself honor on Pharaoh, on his chariots, and on his horsemen. 
14:19 And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them: 
14:20 and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness. And it lit up the night. And the one didn't come near the other all night.
14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Yahweh caused the sea to go [back] by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 
14:22 And the sons of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground: and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. 
14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
14:24 And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Yahweh looked forth on the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians. 
14:25 And he locked their chariot wheels, and they were hard to drive; so the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians.
14:26 And Yahweh said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen. 
14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 
14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of the whole host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; not so much as one of them remained. 
14:29 But the sons of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. 
14:30 Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. 
14:31 And Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did on the Egyptians, and the people feared Yahweh: and they believed in Yahweh, and in his slave Moses.
15:1 Then sang Moses and the sons of Israel this song to Yahweh, and spoke, saying, I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea. 
15:2 Yah is my strength and song, And he has become my salvation: This is my God, and I will praise him; My father's God, and I will exalt him. 
15:3 Yahweh is a man of war: Yahweh is his name. 
15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host he has cast into the sea; And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea. 
15:5 The deeps cover them: They went down into the depths like a stone. 
15:6 Your right hand, O Yahweh, is glorious in power, Your right hand, O Yahweh, dashes in pieces the enemy. 
15:7 And in the greatness of your excellency you overthrow those who rise up against you: You send forth your wrath, it consumes them as stubble. 
15:8 And with the blast of your nostrils the waters were piled up, The floods stood upright as a heap; The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea. 
15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My soul will be satisfied on them; I will draw my sword, my hand will destroy them. 
15:10 You blew with your wind, the sea covered them: They sank as lead in the majestic waters. 
15:11 Who is like you, O Yahweh, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, awesome in praises, doing wonders? 
15:12 You stretched out your right hand, The earth swallowed them. 
15:13 You in your loving-kindness have led the people that you have redeemed: You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation. 
15:14 The peoples have heard, they tremble: Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia. 
15:15 Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed; The mighty men of Moab, trembling takes hold on them: All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away. 
15:16 Terror and dread falls on them; By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone; Until your people pass over, O Yahweh, Until the people pass over who you have purchased. 
15:17 You will bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, The place, O Yahweh, which you have made for you to dwell in, The sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands have established. 
15:18 Yahweh will reign forever and ever.
15:19 For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the sons of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea. 
15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. 
15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing<sup><small>+</small></sup> to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously; The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.
15:22 And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 
15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore it was named Marah. 
15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? 
15:25 And he cried to Yahweh; And Yahweh showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them; 
15:26 and he said, If you will diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I have put on the Egyptians: for I am Yahweh who heals you.
15:27 And they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm-trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 
16:2 And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness: 
16:3 and the sons of Israel said to them, Oh that we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots, when we ate bread to the full; for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
16:4 Then Yahweh said to Moses, Look, I will rain bread from heaven for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; and the people will go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not. 
16:5 And it will come to pass on the sixth day, that they will prepare that which they bring in, and it will be twice as much as they gather daily. 
16:6 And Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, At evening, then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will know that Yahweh has brought you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out from the land of Egypt; 
16:7 and in the morning, then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will see the glory of Yahweh; because he hears your<sup><small>+</small></sup> murmurings against Yahweh: and what are we, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> murmur against us? 
16:8 And Moses said, [This will be], when Yahweh will give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; because Yahweh hears your<sup><small>+</small></sup> murmurings which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> murmur against him: and what are we? Your<sup><small>+</small></sup> murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh. 
16:9 And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, Come near before Yahweh; for he has heard your<sup><small>+</small></sup> murmurings. 
16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and saw that the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud. 
16:11 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
16:12 I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel: speak to them, saying, At evening you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will eat flesh, and in the morning you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be filled with bread: and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will know that I am Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God.
16:13 And it came to pass at evening, that the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp. 
16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, look, on the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground. 
16:15 And when the sons of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? For they didn't know what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which Yahweh has given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to eat. 
16:16 This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, Gather<sup><small>+</small></sup> of it every man according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> souls, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will take it, every man for those who are in his tent. 
16:17 And the sons of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less. 
16:18 And when they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. 
16:19 And Moses said to them, Let no man leave of it until the morning. 
16:20 Notwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was angry with them.
16:21 And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. 
16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 
16:23 And he said to them, This is that which Yahweh has spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh: bake that which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will bake, and boil that which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning. 
16:24 And they laid it up until the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any maggot in it. 
16:25 And Moses said, Eat that today; for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh: today you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not find it in the field. 
16:26 Six days you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will gather it; but on the seventh day is the Sabbath, in it there will be none. 
16:27 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none. 
16:28 And Yahweh said to Moses, How long do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? 
16:29 See, since Yahweh has given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the Sabbath, therefore he gives you<sup><small>+</small></sup> on the sixth day the bread of two days; remain<sup><small>+</small></sup> every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 
16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
16:31 And the house of Israel called its name Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers [made] with honey. 
16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, Let a full omer of it be kept throughout your<sup><small>+</small></sup> generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the wilderness, when I brought you<sup><small>+</small></sup> forth from the land of Egypt. 
16:33 And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept throughout your<sup><small>+</small></sup> generations. 
16:34 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. 
16:35 And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they ate the manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan. 
16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
17:1 And all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the mouth of Yahweh, and encamped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink. 
17:2 Therefore the people strove with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> strive with me? Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> try Yahweh? 
17:3 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our sons and our cattle with thirst? 
17:4 And Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, What shall I do to this people? They are almost ready to stone me. 
17:5 And Yahweh said to Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with you of the elders of Israel; and your rod, with which you struck the river, take in your hand, and go. 
17:6 Look, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you will strike the rock, and there will come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the sons of Israel, and because they tried Yahweh, saying, Is Yahweh among us, or not?
17:8 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
17:9 And Moses said to Joshua, Choose men for us to go out and fight with Amalek: tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand. 
17:10 So Joshua did as Moses told him to fight with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 
17:12 But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 
17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
17:14 And Yahweh said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will completely blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. 
17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Yahweh-nissi; 
17:16 And he said, Since a hand was raised to Yah's throne, Yahweh will be at war with Amalek from generation to generation.
18:1 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt. 
18:2 And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away, 
18:3 and her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land: 
18:4 and the name of the other was Eliezer; for [he said], The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh. 
18:5 And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God: 
18:6 and he said to Moses, I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you, and your wife, and her two sons with her. 
18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. 
18:8 And Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how Yahweh delivered them. 
18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh. 
18:11 Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods; indeed, in the very thing through which they dealt proudly against them. 
18:12 And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
18:13 And it came to pass on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood about Moses from the morning to the evening. 
18:14 And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that you do to the people? Why do you sit yourself alone, and all the people stand about you from morning to evening? 
18:15 And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God: 
18:16 when they have a matter, it comes to me; and I judge between a man and his fellow man, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. 
18:17 And Moses' father-in-law said to him, The thing that you do is not good. 
18:18 You will surely wear away, both you, and this people with you: for the thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it yourself alone. 
18:19 Now listen to my voice, I will give you counsel, and God be with you: be for the people toward God, and you bring the causes to God: 
18:20 and you will teach them the statutes and the laws, and will show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do. 
18:21 Moreover you will provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 
18:22 and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it will be, that every great matter they will bring to you, but every small matter they will judge themselves: so it will be easier for yourself, and they will bear [the burden] with you. 
18:23 If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace. 
18:24 So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. 
18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 
18:27 And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
19:1 In the third month after the sons of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. 
19:2 And when they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount. 
19:3 And Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus you will say to the house of Jacob, and tell the sons of Israel: 
19:4 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> on eagles' wings, and brought you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to myself. 
19:5 Now therefore, if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be my own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine: 
19:6 and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which you will speak to the sons of Israel.
19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Yahweh commanded him. 
19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that Yahweh has spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh. 
19:9 And Yahweh said to Moses, Look, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever. And Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh. 
19:10 And Yahweh said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments, 
19:11 and be ready against the third day; for the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on mount Sinai. 
19:12 And you will set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't go up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever touches the mount will be surely put to death: 
19:13 no hand will touch him, but he will surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it is beast or man, he will not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they will come up to the mount. 
19:14 And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments. 
19:15 And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: don't come near a woman.
19:16 And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceedingly loud; and all the people who were in the camp trembled. 
19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 
19:18 And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 
19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice. 
19:20 And Yahweh came down on mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. 
19:21 And Yahweh said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, or else they will break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them will perish. 
19:22 And let the priests also, that come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, or else Yahweh will break forth on them. 
19:23 And Moses said to Yahweh, The people can't come up to mount Sinai: for you charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. 
19:24 And Yahweh said to him, Go, get down; and you will come up, you, and Aaron with you: but don't let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, or else he will break forth on them. 
19:25 So Moses went down to the people, and told them.
20:1 And God spoke all these words, saying, 
20:2 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves.
20:3 You will have no other gods before me.
20:4 You will not make for yourself a graven image, nor any likeness [of any thing] that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 
20:5 You will not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I Yahweh your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the sons, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me, 
20:6 and showing loving-kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
20:7 You will not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain; for Yahweh will not hold him innocent who takes his name in vain.
20:8 Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
20:9 Six days you will labor, and do all your work; 
20:10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God: you will not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your male slave, nor your female slave, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is inside your gates: 
20:11 for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day: therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.
20:12 Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
20:13 You will not kill.
20:14 You will not commit adultery.
20:15 You will not steal.
20:16 You will not bear false witness against your fellow man.
20:17 You will not covet your fellow man's house, you will not covet your fellow man's wife, nor his male slave, nor his female slave, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your fellow man's.
20:18 And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood far off. 
20:19 And they said to Moses, You speak with us, and we will hear; but don't let God speak with us, or else we will die. 
20:20 And Moses said to the people, Don't be afraid: for God has come to prove you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and that his fear may be before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't sin. 
20:21 And the people stood far off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
20:22 And Yahweh said to Moses, Thus you will say to the sons of Israel, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> yourselves have seen that I have talked with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> from heaven. 
20:23 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not make me [into anything]. Gods of silver or gods of gold you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not make for yourselves. 
20:24 An altar of earth you will make to me, and will sacrifice on it your burnt-offerings, and your peace-offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you. 
20:25 And if you make me an altar of stone, you will not build it of cut stones; for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it. 
20:26 Neither will you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness will not be uncovered on it.
21:1 Now these are the ordinances which you will set before them.
21:2 If you buy a Hebrew slave, six years he will serve: and in the seventh he will go out free for nothing. 
21:3 If he comes in by himself, he will go out by himself: if he is married, then his wife will go out with him. 
21:4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters; the wife and her children will be her master's, and he will go out by himself. 
21:5 But if the slave plainly says, I love my master, my wife, and my sons; I will not go out free: 
21:6 then his master will bring him to the gods, and will bring him to the door, or to the door-post; and his master will bore his ear through with an awl; and he will serve him forever.
21:7 And if a man sells his daughter to be a slave, she will not go out as the male slaves do. 
21:8 If she doesn't please her master, who has espoused her to himself, then he will let her be redeemed: to sell her to a foreign people he will have no power, seeing he has betrayed her. 
21:9 And if he espouses her to his son, he will deal with her after the manner of daughters. 
21:10 If he takes him another [wife]; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, he will not diminish. 
21:11 And if he does not do these three things to her, then she will go out for nothing, without silver.
21:12 He who strikes a man, so that he dies, will surely be put to death. 
21:13 And if a man does not lie in wait, but God delivers [him] into his hand; then I will appoint you a place where he will flee. 
21:14 And if a man comes presumptuously on his fellow man, to slay him with guile; you will take him from my altar, that he may die.
21:15 And he who strikes his father, or his mother, will be surely put to death.
21:16 And he who steals a man, and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, he will surely be put to death.
21:17 And he who curses his father or his mother, will surely be put to death.
21:18 And if men contend, and a man strikes his fellow man with a stone, or with his fist, and he doesn't die, but keeps his bed; 
21:19 if he rises again, and walks abroad on his staff, then he who struck him will be innocent: he will only pay for the loss of his time, and will cause him to be thoroughly healed.
21:20 And if a man strikes his male slave, or his female slave, with a rod, and he dies under his hand; he will surely be punished. 
21:21 Notwithstanding, if he continues a day or two, he will not be punished: for he is his silver.
21:22 And if men strive together, and hurt a pregnant woman so that her children are born prematurely and no harm follows; he will be surely fined, according to as the woman's husband will lay on him; and he will pay as the judges determine. 
21:23 But if any harm follows, then you will give soul for soul, 
21:24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
21:25 burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
21:26 And if a man strikes the eye of his male slave, or the eye of his female slave, and destroys it; he will let him go free for his eye's sake. 
21:27 And if he strikes out his male slave's tooth, or his female slave's tooth, he will let him go free for his tooth's sake.
21:28 And if an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox will be surely stoned, and its flesh will not be eaten; but the owner of the ox will be innocent. 
21:29 But if the ox was in the habit to gore in time past, and it has been testified to its owner, and he has not kept it in, but it has killed a man or a woman, the ox will be stoned, and its owner also will be put to death. 
21:30 If there is laid on him a ransom, then he will give for the redemption of his soul whatever is laid on him. 
21:31 Whether it has gored a son, or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment it will be done to him. 
21:32 If the ox gores a male slave or a female slave, there will be given to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox will be stoned.
21:33 And if a man will open a pit, or if a man will dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or a donkey fall in it, 
21:34 the owner of the pit will make it good; he will give silver to its owner, and the dead [beast] will be his.
21:35 And if a man's ox hurts his fellow man's ox, so that it dies, then they will sell the live ox, and divide the silver [from the sale] of it: and the dead they will also divide. 
21:36 Or if it is known that the ox was in the habit to gore in time past, and its owner has not kept it in, he will surely pay ox for ox, and the dead [beast] will be his own.
22:1 If a man will steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he will pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. 
22:2 If the thief is found breaking in, and is struck so that he dies, there will be no bloodguiltiness for him. 
22:3 If the sun is risen on him, there will be bloodguiltiness for him; he will make restitution: if he has nothing, then he will be sold for his theft. 
22:4 If the theft is found in his hand alive, whether it is ox, or donkey, or sheep, he will pay double.
22:5 If a man will cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and will let his beast loose, and it feeds in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, he will make restitution.
22:6 If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; he who kindled the fire will surely make restitution.
22:7 If a man will deliver to his fellow man silver or stuff to keep, and it is stolen out of the man's house; if the thief is found, he will pay double. 
22:8 If the thief is not found, then the master of the house will come near to the gods, [to see] whether he has not put his hand to his fellow man's goods. 
22:9 For every matter of trespass, whether it is for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for raiment, [or] for any manner of lost thing, of which one says, This is it, the cause of both parties will come before the gods; he whom the gods will condemn will pay double to his fellow man.
22:10 If a man delivers to his fellow man a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it dies, or is hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it: 
22:11 the oath of Yahweh will be between them both, whether he has not put his hand to his fellow man's goods; and its owner will accept it, and he will not make restitution. 
22:12 But if it is stolen from him, he will make restitution to its owner. 
22:13 If it is torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness: he will not make good that which was torn.
22:14 And if a man borrows anything of his fellow man, and it is hurt, or dies, its owner not being with it, he will surely make restitution. 
22:15 If its owner is with it, he will not make it good: if it is rented, it is included in its rental payment.
22:16 And if a man entices a virgin who is not betrothed, and lies with her, he will surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife. 
22:17 If her father completely refuses to give her to him, he will pay silver according to the dowry of virgins.
22:18 You will not allow a witch to live.
22:19 Whoever lies with a beast will surely be put to death.
22:20 Whoever sacrifices to the gods will be completely destroyed. 
22:21 And a sojourner you will not wrong, neither will you oppress him: for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were sojourners in the land of Egypt. 
22:22 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. 
22:23 If you afflict him at all, and he cries at all to me, I will surely hear his cry; 
22:24 and my wrath will wax hot, and I will kill you<sup><small>+</small></sup> with the sword; and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> wives will be widows, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons fatherless.
22:25 If you lend silver to any of my people with you who is poor, you will not be to him as a creditor; neither will you<sup><small>+</small></sup> lay on him interest. 
22:26 If you at all take your fellow man's garment for a pledge, you will restore it to him before the sun goes down: 
22:27 for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin: in what will he sleep? And it will come to pass, when he cries to me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.
22:28 You will not revile the gods, nor curse a ruler of your people. 
22:29 You will not delay to offer of your harvest, and of the outflow of your presses. The firstborn of your sons you will give to me. 
22:30 Likewise you will do with your oxen, [and] with your sheep: seven days it will be with its dam; on the eighth day you will give it to me. 
22:31 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be holy men to me: therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will cast it to the dogs.
23:1 You will not take up a false report: don't put your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. 
23:2 You will not follow a multitude to do evil; neither will you speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to pervert [justice]: 
23:3 neither will you favor a poor man in his cause.
23:4 If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey going astray, you will surely bring it back to him again. 
23:5 If you see the donkey of him who hates you lying under his burden, you will forbear to leave him, you will strengthen [it] with him.
23:6 You will not pervert the justice [due] to your poor in his cause. 
23:7 Keep far from a false matter; and do not slay the innocent and righteous: for I will not justify the wicked. 
23:8 And you will take no bribe: for a bribe blinds those who have sight, and perverts the words of the righteous. 
23:9 And a sojourner you will not oppress: for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know the soul of a sojourner, seeing you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
23:10 And six years you will sow your land, and will gather in its increase: 
23:11 but the seventh year you will let it rest and lie fallow; that the poor of your people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field will eat. In like manner you will deal with your vineyard, [and] with your oliveyard. 
23:12 Six days you will do your work, and on the seventh day you will rest; that your ox and your donkey may have rest, and the son of your female slave, and the sojourner, may be refreshed. 
23:13 And in all things that I have said to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> you<sup><small>+</small></sup> take heed: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth.
23:14 Three times you will keep a feast to me in the year. 
23:15 The feast of unleavened bread you will keep: seven days you will eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it you came out from Egypt); and no one will appear before me empty: 
23:16 and the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you sow in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when you gather in your labors out of the field. 
23:17 Three times in the year all your males will appear before the Sovereign Yahweh.
23:18 You will not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither will the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning. 
23:19 The first of the first fruits of your ground you will bring into the house of Yahweh your God. You will not boil a young goat in it mother's milk.
23:20 Look, I send an angel before you, to keep you by the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. 
23:21 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> take heed before him, and listen to his voice; don't provoke him; for he will not pardon your<sup><small>+</small></sup> transgression: for my name is in him. 
23:22 But if you will indeed listen to his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and an adversary to your adversaries. 
23:23 For my angel will go before you, and bring you in to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and I will cut them off. 
23:24 You will not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but you will completely overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars. 
23:25 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will serve Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, and he will bless your bread, and your water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of you. 
23:26 There will be none that cast her young, nor that will be barren, in your land: the number of your days I will fulfill. 
23:27 I will send my terror before you, and will discomfit all the people to whom you will come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you. 
23:28 And I will send the hornet before you, which will drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before you. 
23:29 I will not drive them out from before you in one year, or else the land will become desolate, and the beasts of the field will multiply against you. 
23:30 By little and little I will drive them out from before you, until you are increased, and inherit the land. 
23:31 And I will set your border from the Red Sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand: and you will drive them out before you. 
23:32 You will make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 
23:33 They will not dwell in your land, or else they will make you sin against me; for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.
24:1 And he said to Moses, Come up to Yahweh, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> worship far off: 
24:2 and Moses alone will come near to Yahweh; but they will not come near; neither will the people go up with him. 
24:3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh, and all the ordinances: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Yahweh has spoken we will do. 
24:4 And Moses wrote all the words of Yahweh, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. 
24:5 And he sent young men of the sons of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen to Yahweh. 
24:6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 
24:7 And he took the Book of the Covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that Yahweh has spoken we will do, and be obedient. 
24:8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Here is the blood of the covenant, which Yahweh has made with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> concerning all these words.
24:9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. 
24:10 And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for clearness. 
24:11 And on the nobles of the sons of Israel he didn't lay his hand: and they saw God, and ate and drank.
24:12 And Yahweh said to Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give you the tables of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that you may teach them. 
24:13 And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister: and Moses went up into the mount of God. 
24:14 And he said to the elders, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> tarry here for us, until we come again to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: and, look, Aaron and Hur are with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: whoever has a cause, let him come near to them. 
24:15 And Moses went up into the mount, and the cloud covered the mount. 
24:16 And the glory of Yahweh stayed on mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. 
24:17 And the appearance of the glory of Yahweh was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the sons of Israel. 
24:18 And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.
25:1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
25:2 Speak to the sons of Israel, that they take for me an offering: of every man whose heart makes him willing you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will take my offering. 
25:3 And this is the offering which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will take of them: gold, and silver, and bronze, 
25:4 and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' [hair], 
25:5 and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood, 
25:6 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, 
25:7 onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. 
25:8 And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may stay among them. 
25:9 According to all that I show you, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all its furniture, even so you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will make it.
25:10 And they will make an ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half will be its length, and a cubit and a half its width, and a cubit and a half its height. 
25:11 And you will overlay it with pure gold, inside and outside you will overlay it, and will make on it a crown of gold round about. 
25:12 And you will cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet of it; and two rings will be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. 
25:13 And you will make poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. 
25:14 And you will put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, with which to bear the ark. 
25:15 The poles will be in the rings of the ark: they will not be taken from it. 
25:16 And you will put into the ark the testimony which I will give you. 
25:17 And you will make a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half [will be] its length, and a cubit and a half its width. 
25:18 And you will make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work you will make them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat. 
25:19 And make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will make the cherubim on the two ends of it. 
25:20 And the cherubim will spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat will the faces of the cherubim be. 
25:21 And you will put the mercy-seat above on the ark; and in the ark you will put the testimony that I will give you. 
25:22 And there I will meet with you, and I will commune with you from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give you in commandment to the sons of Israel.
25:23 And you will make a table of acacia wood: two cubits [will be] its length, and a cubit its width, and a cubit and a half its height. 
25:24 And you will overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about. 
25:25 And you will make to it a border of a handbreadth round about; and you will make a golden crown to its border round about. 
25:26 And you will make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet of it. 
25:27 Close by the border will the rings be, for places for the poles to bear the table. 
25:28 And you will make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them. 
25:29 And you will make its dishes, and its spoons, and its flagons, and its bowls, with which to pour out: of pure gold you will make them. 
25:30 And you will set on the table showbread before me always.
25:31 And you will make a lampstand of pure gold: of beaten work will the lampstand be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, will be of one piece with it. 
25:32 And there will be six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand out of the one side of it, and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side of it: 
25:33 three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the lampstand: 
25:34 and in the lampstand four cups made like almond-blossoms, its knops, and its flowers; 
25:35 and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the lampstand. 
25:36 Their knops and their branches will be of one piece with it; the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold. 
25:37 And you will make its lamps, seven: and the lamps will be set up and it will give light in front of it. 
25:38 And its snuffers, and its snuffdishes, will be of pure gold. 
25:39 Of a talent of pure gold it will be made, with all these vessels. 
25:40 And see that you make them after their pattern, which has been shown to you in the mount.
26:1 Moreover you will make the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim the work of the skillful workman you will make them. 
26:2 The length of each curtain will be eight and twenty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits: all the curtains will have one measure. 
26:3 Five curtains will be coupled together one to another; and [the other] five curtains will be coupled one to another. 
26:4 And you will make loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise you will make in the edge of the curtain that is outermost in the second coupling. 
26:5 Fifty loops you will make in the one curtain, and fifty loops you will make in the edge of the curtain that is in the second coupling; the loops will be opposite one to another. 
26:6 And you will make fifty clasps of gold, and couple the curtains one to another with the clasps: and the tabernacle will be one [whole].
26:7 And you will make curtains of goats' [hair] for a tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains you will make them. 
26:8 The length of each curtain will be thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits: the eleven curtains will have one measure. 
26:9 And you will couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and will double over the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tent. 
26:10 And you will make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outermost in the coupling, and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain which is joined in a second coupling. 
26:11 And you will make fifty clasps of bronze, and put the clasps into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one. 
26:12 And the overhanging part that remains of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remains, will hang over the back of the tabernacle. 
26:13 And the cubit on the one side, and the cubit on the other side, of that which remains in the length of the curtains of the tent, will hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it. 
26:14 And you will make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above.
26:15 And you will make the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up. 
26:16 Ten cubits will be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the width of each board. 
26:17 Two tenons there will be in each board, joined one to another: thus you will make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
26:18 And you will make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side southward. 
26:19 And you will make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 
26:20 And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, twenty boards, 
26:21 and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 
26:22 And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward you will make six boards. 
26:23 And two boards you will make for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part. 
26:24 And they will be a pair at the bottom, but joined together at its top to one ring: thus it will be for them both; they will be for the two corners. 
26:25 And there will be eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
26:26 And you will make bars of acacia wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 
26:27 and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the hinder part westward. 
26:28 And the middle bar in the midst of the boards will pass through from end to end. 
26:29 And you will overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for places for the bars: and you will overlay the bars with gold. 
26:30 And you will rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion of it which has been shown to you in the mount.
26:31 And you will make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim the work of the skillful workman it will be made. 
26:32 And you will hang it on four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold; their hooks [will be] of gold, on four sockets of silver. 
26:33 And you will hang up the veil under the clasps, and will bring in there inside the veil the ark of the testimony: and the veil will separate to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> between the holy place and the most holy. 
26:34 And you will put the mercy-seat on the ark of the testimony in the most holy place. 
26:35 And you will set the table outside the veil, and the lampstand across from the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and you will put the table on the north side.
26:36 And you will make a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer. 
26:37 And you will make for the screen five pillars of acacia, and overlay them with gold: their hooks will be of gold: and you will cast five sockets of bronze for them.
27:1 And you will make the altar of acacia wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar will be foursquare: and its height will be three cubits. 
27:2 And you will make its horns on the four corners of it; its horns will be of one piece with it: and you will overlay it with bronze. 
27:3 And you will make its pots to take away its ashes, and its shovels, and its basins, and its flesh-hooks, and its firepans. As for all its vessels, you will make them of bronze. 
27:4 And you will make for it a grating of network of bronze: and on the net you will make four bronze rings in the four corners of it. 
27:5 And you will put it under the ledge around the altar beneath, that the net may reach halfway up the altar. 
27:6 And you will make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze. 
27:7 And its poles will be put into the rings, and the poles will be on the two sides of the altar, in bearing it. 
27:8 Hollow with planks you will make it: as it has been shown to you in the mount, so they will make it.
27:9 And you will make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward there will be hangings for the court of fine twined linen a hundred cubits long for one side: 
27:10 and its pillars will be twenty, and their sockets twenty, of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets [will be] of silver. 
27:11 And likewise for the north side in length there will be hangings a hundred cubits long, and its pillars twenty, and their sockets twenty, of bronze; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver. 
27:12 And for the width of the court on the west side will be hangings of fifty cubits; their pillars ten, and their sockets ten. 
27:13 And the width of the court on the east side eastward will be fifty cubits. 
27:14 The hangings for the one side [of the gate] will be fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. 
27:15 And for the other side will be hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. 
27:16 And for the gate of the court will be a screen of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer; their pillars four, and their sockets four. 
27:17 All the pillars of the court round about will be filleted with silver; their hooks of silver, and their sockets of bronze. 
27:18 The length of the court will be a hundred cubits, and the width fifty at both ends, and the height five cubits, of fine twined linen, and their sockets of bronze. 
27:19 As for all the instruments of the tabernacle in all its service, and all its pins, and all the pins of the court, they will be of bronze.
27:20 And you will command the sons of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. 
27:21 In the tent of meeting, outside the veil which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons will keep it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh: it will be a statute forever throughout their generations on the behalf of the sons of Israel.
28:1 And you bring near to you Aaron your brother, and his sons with him, from among the sons of Israel, that he may serve me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons. 
28:2 And you will make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for glory and for beauty. 
28:3 And you will speak to all who are wise-hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they make Aaron's garments to sanctify him, that he may serve me in the priest's office. 
28:4 And these are the garments which they will make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a coat of checker work, a turban, and a belt: and they will make holy garments for Aaron your brother, and his sons, that he may serve me in the priest's office. 
28:5 And they will take the gold, and the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, and the fine linen.
28:6 And they will make the ephod of gold, of blue, and purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the skillful workman. 
28:7 It will have two shoulder-pieces joined to it. On its two ends it will be joined together. 
28:8 And the skillfully woven band, which is on it, with which to gird it on, will be like its work [and] of the same piece; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 
28:9 And you will take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel: 
28:10 six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the six that remain on the other stone, according to their birth. 
28:11 With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, you will engrave the two stones, according to the names of the sons of Israel: you will make them to be enclosed in settings of gold. 
28:12 And you will put the two stones on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the sons of Israel: and Aaron will bear their names before Yahweh on his two shoulders for a memorial. 
28:13 And you will make settings of gold, 
28:14 and two chains of pure gold; like cords you will make them, of wreathed work: and you will put the wreathed chains on the settings.
28:15 And you will make a breastplate of judgment, the work of the skillful workman; like the work of an ephod you will make it; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, you will make it. 
28:16 Foursquare it will be [and] double; a span will be its length, and a span its width. 
28:17 And you will set in it settings of stones, four rows of stones: a row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle will be the first row; 
28:18 and the second row an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond; 
28:19 and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 
28:20 and the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they will be enclosed in gold in their settings. 
28:21 And the stones will be according to the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, they will be for the twelve tribes. 
28:22 And you will make on the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathed work of pure gold. 
28:23 And you will make on the breastplate two rings of gold, and will put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 
28:24 And you will put the two wreathed chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. 
28:25 And the [other] two ends of the two wreathed chains you will put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod in its forepart. 
28:26 And you will make two rings of gold, and you will put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on its edge, which is toward the side of the ephod inward. 
28:27 And you will make two rings of gold, and will put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in its forepart, close by its coupling, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod. 
28:28 And they will bind the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate may not be loosed from the ephod. 
28:29 And Aaron will bear the names of the sons of Israel in the breastplate of judgment on his heart, when he goes in to the holy place, for a memorial before Yahweh continually. 
28:30 And you will put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they will be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before Yahweh: and Aaron will bear the judgment of the sons of Israel on his heart before Yahweh continually.
28:31 And you will make the robe of the ephod all of blue. 
28:32 And it will have a hole for the head in the midst of it: it will have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of a coat of mail, that it is not rent. 
28:33 And on the skirts of it you will make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about its skirts; and bells of gold between them round about: 
28:34 a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, on the skirts of the robe round about. 
28:35 And it will be on Aaron to minister: and its sound will be heard when he goes in to the holy place before Yahweh, and when he comes out, that he will not die.
28:36 And you will make a plate of pure gold, and engrave on it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO YAHWEH. 
28:37 And you will put it on a lace of blue, and it will be on the turban; on the forefront of the turban it will be. 
28:38 And it will be on Aaron's forehead, and Aaron will bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the sons of Israel will hallow in all their holy gifts; and it will be always on his forehead, that they may be accepted before Yahweh. 
28:39 And you will weave the coat in checker work of fine linen, and you will make a turban of fine linen, and you will make a belt, the work of the embroiderer.
28:40 And for Aaron's sons you will make coats, and you will make for them belts, and head-tires you will make for them, for glory and for beauty. 
28:41 And you will put them on Aaron your brother, and on his sons with him, and will anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may serve me in the priest's office. 
28:42 And you will make them linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness; from the loins even to the thighs they will reach: 
28:43 And they will be on Aaron, and on his sons, when they go in to the tent of meeting, or when they come near to the altar to minister in the holy place; that they will not bear iniquity, and die: it will be a statute forever to him and to his seed after him.
29:1 And this is the thing that you will do to them to hallow them, to serve me in the priest's office: take one young bull and two rams without blemish, 
29:2 and unleavened bread, and unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil: of fine wheat flour you will make them. 
29:3 And you will put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bull and the two rams. 
29:4 And Aaron and his sons you will bring to the door of the tent of meeting, and will wash them with water. 
29:5 And you will take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod; 
29:6 and you will set the turban on his head, and put the holy crown on the turban. 
29:7 Then you will take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him. 
29:8 And you will bring his sons, and put coats on them. 
29:9 And you will gird them with belts and bind head-tires on them: and they will have the priesthood by a perpetual statute: and you will consecrate Aaron and his sons.
29:10 And you will bring the bull before the tent of meeting: and Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on the head of the bull. 
29:11 And you will kill the bull before Yahweh, at the door of the tent of meeting. 
29:12 And you will take of the blood of the bull, and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger; and you will pour out all the blood at the base of the altar. 
29:13 And you will take all the fat that covers the insides, and the caul on the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar. 
29:14 But the flesh of the bull, and its skin, and its dung, you will burn with fire outside the camp: it is a sin-offering.
29:15 You will also take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on the head of the ram. 
29:16 And you will slay the ram, and you will take its blood, and sprinkle it round about on the altar. 
29:17 And you will cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its insides, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head. 
29:18 And you will burn the whole ram on the altar: it is a burnt-offering to Yahweh; it is a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
29:19 And you will take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on the head of the ram. 
29:20 Then you will kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put it on the tip of Aaron's and his sons' right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood on the altar round about. 
29:21 And you will take of the blood that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him: and he will be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. 
29:22 Also you will take of the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covers the insides, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of consecration), 
29:23 and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Yahweh. 
29:24 And you will put the whole on the hands of Aaron, and on the hands of his sons, and will wave them for a wave-offering before Yahweh. 
29:25 And you will take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar on the burnt-offering, for a sweet savor before Yahweh: it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
29:26 And you will take the breast of Aaron's ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave-offering before Yahweh: and it will be your portion. 
29:27 And you will sanctify the breast of the wave-offering, and the thigh of the heave-offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons: 
29:28 and it will be for Aaron and his sons as [their] portion forever from the sons of Israel; for it is a heave-offering: and it will be a heave-offering from the sons of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, even their heave-offering to Yahweh.
29:29 And the holy garments of Aaron will be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them. 
29:30 Seven days will the son who is priest in his stead put them on, when he comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.
29:31 And you will take the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place. 
29:32 And Aaron and his sons will eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting. 
29:33 And they will eat those things with which atonement was made, to consecrate [and] to sanctify them: but a stranger will not eat, because they are holy. 
29:34 And if anything of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remains to the morning, then you will burn the remainder with fire: it will not be eaten, because it is holy.
29:35 And thus you will do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you: seven days you will consecrate them. 
29:36 And every day you will offer the bull of sin-offering for atonement: and you will cleanse the altar, when you make atonement for it; and you will anoint it, to sanctify it. 
29:37 Seven days you will make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar will be most holy; whatever touches the altar will be holy.
29:38 Now this is that which you will offer on the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually. 
29:39 The one lamb you will offer in the morning; and the other lamb you will offer at evening: 
29:40 and with the one lamb a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering. 
29:41 And the other lamb you will offer at evening, and will do thereto according to the meal-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering of it, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Yahweh. 
29:42 It will be a continual burnt-offering throughout your<sup><small>+</small></sup> generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Yahweh, where I will meet with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, to speak there to you. 
29:43 And there I will meet with the sons of Israel; and [the Tent] will be sanctified by my glory. 
29:44 And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar: Aaron also and his sons I will sanctify, to serve me in the priest's office. 
29:45 And I will stay among the sons of Israel, and will be their God. 
29:46 And they will know that I am Yahweh their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might stay among them: I am Yahweh their God.
30:1 And you will make an altar to burn incense on: of acacia wood you will make it. 
30:2 A cubit will be its length, and a cubit its width; foursquare it will be; and two cubits will be its height: its horns will be of one piece with it. 
30:3 And you will overlay it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and you will make to it a crown of gold round about. 
30:4 And two golden rings you will make for it under its crown; on the two ribs of it, on the two sides of it you will make them; and they will be for places for poles with which to bear it. 
30:5 And you will make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. 
30:6 And you will put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony where I will meet with you. 
30:7 And Aaron will burn on it incense of sweet spices: every morning, when he dresses the lamps, he will burn it. 
30:8 And when Aaron lights the lamps at evening, he will burn it, a perpetual incense before Yahweh throughout your<sup><small>+</small></sup> generations. 
30:9 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will offer no strange incense on it, nor burnt-offering, nor meal-offering; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will pour no drink-offering on it. 
30:10 And Aaron will make atonement on the horns of it once in the year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once in the year he will make atonement for it throughout your<sup><small>+</small></sup> generations: it is most holy to Yahweh.
30:11 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
30:12 When you take the sum of the sons of Israel, according to those who are numbered of them, then they will give every man a ransom for his soul to Yahweh, when you number them; that there will be no plague among them, because you number them. 
30:13 This they will give, everyone who passes over to those who are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs); half a shekel for an offering to Yahweh. 
30:14 Everyone who passes over to those who are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, will give the offering of Yahweh. 
30:15 The rich will not give more, and the poor will not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Yahweh, to make atonement for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> souls. 
30:16 And you will take the atonement silver from the sons of Israel, and will appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting; that it may be a memorial for the sons of Israel before Yahweh, to make atonement for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> souls.
30:17 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
30:18 You will also make a basin of bronze, and its base of bronze, whereat to wash. And you will put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you will put water in it. 
30:19 And Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and their feet from it: 
30:20 when they go into the tent of meeting, they will wash with water, that they will not die; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to Yahweh. 
30:21 So they will wash their hands and their feet, that they will not die: and it will be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.
30:22 Moreover Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
30:23 You also take to you the chief spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred [shekels], and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty, 
30:24 and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin. 
30:25 And you will make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it will be a holy anointing oil. 
30:26 And you will anoint with it the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, 
30:27 and the table and all its vessels, and the lampstand and its vessels, and the altar of incense, 
30:28 and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the basin and its base. 
30:29 And you will sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatever touches them will be holy. 
30:30 And you will anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may serve me in the priest's office. 
30:31 And you will speak to the sons of Israel, saying, This will be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your<sup><small>+</small></sup> generations. 
30:32 On the flesh of man it will not be poured, neither will you<sup><small>+</small></sup> make any like it, according to its composition: it is holy, [and] it will be holy to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
30:33 Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, he will be cut off from his people.
30:34 And Yahweh said to Moses, Take to you sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each there will be a like weight; 
30:35 and you will make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure [and] holy: 
30:36 and you will beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you: it will be to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> most holy. 
30:37 And the incense which you will make, according to its composition you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not make for yourselves: it will be to you holy for Yahweh. 
30:38 Whoever will make like that, to smell of it, he will be cut off from his people.
31:1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
31:2 See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 
31:3 and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 
31:4 to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, 
31:5 and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship. 
31:6 And I, look, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you: 
31:7 the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent, 
31:8 and the table and its vessels, and the pure lampstand with all its vessels, and the altar of incense, 
31:9 and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the basin and its base, 
31:10 and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to serve in the priest's office, 
31:11 and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you, they will do.
31:12 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
31:13 You speak also to the sons of Israel, saying, Truly you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will keep my Sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> throughout your<sup><small>+</small></sup> generations; that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
31:14 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: everyone who profanes it will surely be put to death; for whoever does any work in it, that soul will be cut off from among his people. 
31:15 Six days will work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh: whoever does any work on the Sabbath day, he will surely be put to death. 
31:16 Therefore the sons of Israel will keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 
31:17 It is a sign between me and the sons of Israel forever: for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.
31:18 And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, Get up, make us gods, which will go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him. 
32:2 And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> wives, of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons, and of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> daughters, and bring them to me. 
32:3 And all the people broke off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron. 
32:4 And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it [into] a molten calf: and they said, These are your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt. 
32:5 And when Aaron saw [this], he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow will be a feast to Yahweh. 
32:6 And they rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
32:7 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, Go, get down; for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: 
32:8 they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These are your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt. 
32:9 And Yahweh said to Moses, I have seen this people, and, look, it is a stiff-necked people: 
32:10 now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of you a great nation. 
32:11 And Moses implored Yahweh his God, and said, Yahweh, why does your wrath wax hot against your people, whom you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? 
32:12 Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil did he bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people. 
32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your slaves, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your<sup><small>+</small></sup> seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> seed, and they will inherit it forever. 
32:14 And Yahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.
32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written. 
32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables. 
32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. 
32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of those who shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing, I am hearing. 
32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount. 
32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burned it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it on the water, and made the sons of Israel drink of it.
32:21 And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to you, that you have brought a great sin on them? 
32:22 And Aaron said, Don't let the anger of my lord wax hot: you know the people, that they are [set] on evil. 
32:23 For they said to me, Make us gods, which will go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him. 
32:24 And I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them break it off: so they gave it to me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were going wild (for Aaron had let them go wild for a derision among their enemies), 
32:26 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoever is on Yahweh's side, [let him come] to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him. 
32:27 And he said to them, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> put every man his sword on his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man those near to him. 
32:28 And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
32:29 And Moses said, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have been consecrated today to Yahweh, yes, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow on you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a blessing this day.
32:30 And it came to pass on the next day, that Moses said to the people, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up to Yahweh; perhaps I will make atonement for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sin. 
32:31 And Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold. 
32:32 Yet now, if you will forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written. 
32:33 And Yahweh said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him I will blot out of my book. 
32:34 And now go, lead the people to [the place] of which I have spoken to you: look, my angel will go before you; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin on them. 
32:35 And Yahweh struck the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
33:1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, Depart, go up from here, you and the people who you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed I will give it: 
33:2 and I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
33:3 [go up] to a land flowing with milk and honey. For I will not go up in the midst of you. For you are a stiff-necked people. If I did, I would consume you in the way. 
33:4 And when the people heard this evil news, they mourned: and no man put on himself his ornaments. 
33:5 And Yahweh said to Moses, Say to the sons of Israel, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are a stiff-necked people; if I go up into the midst of you for one moment, I will consume you: therefore now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do to you. 
33:6 And the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.
33:7 Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp; and he called it, The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp. 
33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent. 
33:9 And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent: and [Yahweh] spoke with Moses. 
33:10 And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshiped, every man at his tent door. 
33:11 And Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his companion. And he turned again into the camp: but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart out of the Tent.
33:12 And Moses said to Yahweh, See, you say to me, Bring up this people: and you haven't let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight. 
33:13 Now therefore, I pray you, if I have found favor in your sight, show me now your ways, that I may know you, to the end that I may find favor in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people. 
33:14 And he said, My presence will go [with you], and I will give you rest. 
33:15 And he said to him, If your presence doesn't go [with me], don't carry us up from here. 
33:16 For in what now will it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Is it not in that you go with us, so that we are distinguished, I and your people, from all the people who are on the face of the earth?
33:17 And Yahweh said to Moses, I will also do this thing that you have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name. 
33:18 And he said, Show me, I pray you, your glory. 
33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. 
33:20 And he said, You can not see my face; for man will not see me and live. 
33:21 And Yahweh said, Look, there is a place by me, and you will stand on the rock: 
33:22 and it will come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by: 
33:23 and I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face will not be seen.
34:1 And Yahweh said to Moses, Cut for yourself two tables of stone like the first ones: and I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables, which you broke. 
34:2 And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mount. 
34:3 And no man will come up with you; neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. 
34:4 And he cut two tables of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone. 
34:5 And Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Yahweh. 
34:6 And Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, Yahweh, Yahweh God, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness and truth, 
34:7 keeping loving-kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means leave unpunished [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the sons, and on the sons of the sons, on the third and on the fourth generation. 
34:8 And Moses hurried, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped. 
34:9 And he said, If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray you, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.
34:10 And he said, Look, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as haven't been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which you are will see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you. 
34:11 You observe that which I command you this day: look, I drive out before you the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
34:12 You be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you go, or else it will be for a snare in the midst of you. 
34:13 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will cut down their Asherim. 
34:14 For you will worship no other god. For Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. 
34:15 Or else, if you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, who prostitute after their gods and sacrifice to their gods, they will call you. And you will eat of their sacrifice. 
34:16 And when you take of their daughters--who prostitute after their gods--to your sons, then their daughters will make your sons prostitute after their gods. 
34:17 You will make yourself no molten gods.
34:18 The feast of unleavened bread you will keep. Seven days you will eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt. 
34:19 All that opens the womb is mine; and you will separate the males of all your cattle, the firstborns of cow and sheep. 
34:20 And the firstborn of a donkey you will redeem with a lamb: and if you will not redeem, then you will break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you will redeem. And none will appear before me empty.
34:21 Six days you will work, but on the seventh day you will rest: in plowing time and in harvest you will rest. 
34:22 And you will observe the feast of weeks, [even] of the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. 
34:23 Three times in the year will all your males appear before the Sovereign Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
34:24 For I will cast out nations before you, and enlarge your borders: neither will any man desire your land, when you go up to see the face of Yahweh your God three times in the year.
34:25 You will not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither will the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning. 
34:26 The first of the first fruits of your ground you will bring to the house of Yahweh your God. You will not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
34:27 And Yahweh said to Moses, You write these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel. 
34:28 And he was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread, nor drank water. And he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses didn't know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him. 
34:30 And when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, look, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him. 
34:31 And Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him: and Moses spoke to them. 
34:32 And afterward all the sons of Israel came near: and he gave them in commandment all that Yahweh had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 
34:33 And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face. 
34:34 But when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke to the sons of Israel that which he was commanded. 
34:35 And the sons of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
35:1 And Moses assembled all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and said to them, These are the words which Yahweh has commanded, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> should do them. 
35:2 Six days will work be done; but on the seventh day there will be to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a holy day, a Sabbath of solemn rest to Yahweh: whoever does any work in it will be put to death. 
35:3 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will kindle no fire throughout your<sup><small>+</small></sup> habitations on the Sabbath day.
35:4 And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Yahweh commanded, saying, 
35:5 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> take from among you<sup><small>+</small></sup> an offering to Yahweh; whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, Yahweh's offering: gold, and silver, and bronze, 
35:6 and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' [hair], 
35:7 and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood, 
35:8 and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, 
35:9 and onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
35:10 And let every wise-hearted man among you<sup><small>+</small></sup> come, and make all that Yahweh has commanded: 
35:11 the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; 
35:12 the ark, and its poles, the mercy-seat, and the veil of the screen; 
35:13 the table, and its poles, and all its vessels, and the showbread; 
35:14 the lampstand also for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light; 
35:15 and the altar of incense, and its poles, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle; 
35:16 the altar of burnt-offering, with its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its vessels, the basin and its base; 
35:17 the hangings of the court, its pillars, and their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court; 
35:18 the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords; 
35:19 the finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to serve in the priest's office.
35:20 And all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
35:21 And everyone [of the wise-hearted] whose heart stirred him up came; and everyone whom his spirit made willing brought Yahweh's offering, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments. 
35:22 And the men as well as the women, as many as were willing-hearted, brought brooches, and earrings, and signet-rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man who offered an offering of gold to Yahweh. 
35:23 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' [hair], and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, brought them. 
35:24 Everyone who offered an offering of silver and bronze brought Yahweh's offering; and every man, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it. 
35:25 And all the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen. 
35:26 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' [hair]. 
35:27 And the rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; 
35:28 and the spice, and the oil; for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. 
35:29 The sons of Israel brought a freewill-offering to Yahweh; every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which Yahweh had commanded to be made by Moses.
35:30 And Moses said to the sons of Israel, See, Yahweh has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 
35:31 And he has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; 
35:32 and to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, 
35:33 and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of skillful workmanship. 
35:34 And he has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
35:35 He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, and of the skillful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do any workmanship, and of those who devise skillful works. 
36:1 And Bezalel and Oholiab will work, and every wise-hearted man, in whom Yahweh has put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that Yahweh has commanded.
36:2 And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart Yahweh had put wisdom, even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it: 
36:3 and they received of Moses all the offering which the sons of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, with which to make it. And they brought yet to him freewill-offerings every morning. 
36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they wrought. 
36:5 And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Yahweh commanded to make. 
36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make anymore work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were kept back from bringing. 
36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
36:8 And all the wise-hearted men among them who wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skillful workman, [Bezalel] made them. 
36:9 The length of each curtain was eight and twenty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits: all the curtains had one measure. 
36:10 And he coupled five curtains one to another: and [the other] five curtains he coupled one to another. 
36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second coupling. 
36:12 Fifty loops he made in the one curtain, and fifty loops he made in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling: the loops were opposite one to another. 
36:13 And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was one.
36:14 And he made curtains of goats' [hair] for a tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. 
36:15 The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the width of each curtain: the eleven curtains had one measure. 
36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 
36:17 And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the coupling, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the curtain which was [outermost in] the second coupling. 
36:18 And he made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together, that it might be one. 
36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above.
36:20 And he made the boards for the tabernacle, of acacia wood, standing up. 
36:21 Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the width of each board. 
36:22 Each board had two tenons, joined one to another: thus he made for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
36:23 And he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward. 
36:24 And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 
36:25 And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards, 
36:26 and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 
36:27 And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
36:28 And two boards he made for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part. 
36:29 And they were a pair at the bottom, but they were joined together at its top to one ring: thus he did to both of them in the two corners. 
36:30 And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets.
36:31 And he made bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 
36:32 and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward. 
36:33 And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other. 
36:34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
36:35 And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim, the work of the skillful workman, he made it. 
36:36 And he made thereto four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; And he cast for them four sockets of silver. 
36:37 And he made a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer; 
36:38 and the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold; and their five sockets were of bronze.
37:1 And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the width of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it: 
37:2 and he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a crown of gold to it round about. 
37:3 And he cast for it four rings of gold, in the four feet of it; even two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. 
37:4 And he made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
37:5 And he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. 
37:6 And he made a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half [was] its length, and a cubit and a half its width. 
37:7 And he made two cherubim of gold; of beaten work he made them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat; 
37:8 one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat he made the cherubim at the two ends of it. 
37:9 And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim.
37:10 And he made the table of acacia wood: two cubits [was] its length, and a cubit its width, and a cubit and a half its height: 
37:11 and he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereto a crown of gold round about. 
37:12 And he made to it a border of a handbreadth round about, and made a golden crown to its border round about. 
37:13 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that were on the four feet of it. 
37:14 Close by the border were the rings, the places for the poles to bear the table. 
37:15 And he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table. 
37:16 And he made the vessels which were on the table, its dishes, and its spoons, and its bowls, and its flagons, with which to pour out, of pure gold.
37:17 And he made the lampstand of pure gold: of beaten work he made the lampstand, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, were of one piece with it: 
37:18 and there were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand out of the one side of it, and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side of it: 
37:19 three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower, and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the lampstand. 
37:20 And in the lampstand were four cups made like almond-blossoms, its knops, and its flowers; 
37:21 and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it. 
37:22 Their knops and their branches were of one piece with it: the whole of it was one beaten work of pure gold. 
37:23 And he made its lamps, seven, and its snuffers, and its snuffdishes, of pure gold. 
37:24 Of a talent of pure gold he made it, and all its vessels.
37:25 And he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit was its length, and a cubit its width, foursquare; and two cubits was its height; its horns were of one piece with it. 
37:26 And he overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and the horns of it: and he made to it a crown of gold round about. 
37:27 And he made for it two golden rings under its crown, on the two ribs of it, on the two sides of it, for places for poles with which to bear it. 
37:28 And he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
37:29 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, after the art of the perfumer.
38:1 And he made the altar of burnt-offering of acacia wood: five cubits was its length, and five cubits its width, foursquare; and three cubits its height. 
38:2 And he made its horns on the four corners of it; its horns were of one piece with it: and he overlaid it with bronze. 
38:3 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, the flesh-hooks, and the firepans: all its vessels he made of bronze. 
38:4 And he made for the altar a grating of network of bronze, under the ledge around it beneath, reaching halfway up. 
38:5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grating of bronze, to be places for the poles. 
38:6 And he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with bronze. 
38:7 And he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to bear it; he made it hollow with planks.
38:8 And he made the basin of bronze, and its base of bronze, of the mirrors of the serving women who served at the door of the tent of meeting.
38:9 And he made the court: for the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits; 
38:10 their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver. 
38:11 And for the north side a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, and their sockets twenty, of bronze; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver. 
38:12 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver. 
38:13 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits. 
38:14 The hangings for the one side [of the gate] were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three; 
38:15 and so for the other side: on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. 
38:16 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen. 
38:17 And the sockets for the pillars were of bronze; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals, of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. 
38:18 And the screen for the gate of the court was the work of the embroiderer, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the width was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court. 
38:19 And their pillars were four, and their sockets four, of bronze; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals, and their fillets, of silver. 
38:20 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of bronze.
38:21 This is the sum of [the things for] the tabernacle, even the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were counted, according to the mouth of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest. 
38:22 And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that Yahweh commanded Moses. 
38:23 And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in fine linen.
38:24 All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
38:25 And the silver of those who were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 
38:26 a beka a head, [that is], half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for everyone who passed over to those who were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men. 
38:27 And the hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil; a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 
38:28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five [shekels] he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and made fillets for them. 
38:29 And the bronze of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels. 
38:30 And with it he made the sockets to the door of the tent of meeting, and the bronze altar, and the bronze grating for it, and all the vessels of the altar, 
38:31 and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.
39:1 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
39:2 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 
39:3 And they beat the gold into thin plates so that they could cut out wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skillful workman. 
39:4 They made shoulder-pieces for it, joined together; at the two ends it was joined together. 
39:5 And the skillfully woven band, that was on it, with which to gird it on, was of the same piece [and] like the work of it; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
39:6 And they wrought the onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold, engraved with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons of Israel. 
39:7 And he put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the sons of Israel; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
39:8 And he made the breastplate, the work of the skillful workman, like the work of an ephod; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 
39:9 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was its length, and a span its width, being double. 
39:10 And they set in it four rows of stones. A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row; 
39:11 and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond; 
39:12 and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 
39:13 and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jaspar: they were enclosed in enclosings of gold in their settings. 
39:14 And the stones were according to the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve tribes. 
39:15 And they made on the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathed work of pure gold. 
39:16 And they made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 
39:17 And they put the two wreathed chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. 
39:18 And the [other] two ends of the two wreathed chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in its forepart. 
39:19 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on its edge, which was toward the side of the ephod inward. 
39:20 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in its forepart, close by its coupling, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod. 
39:21 And they bound the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
39:22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. 
39:23 And the hole of the robe in the midst of it, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent. 
39:24 And they made on the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and of scarlet. 
39:25 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates on the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates; 
39:26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, on the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
39:27 And they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, 
39:28 and the turban of fine linen, and the goodly head-tires of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen, 
39:29 and the belt of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
39:30 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO YAHWEH. 
39:31 And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on the turban above; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
39:32 Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting: and the sons of Israel did according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses; so they did. 
39:33 And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets; 
39:34 and the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, and the veil of the screen; 
39:35 the ark of the testimony, and its poles, and the mercy-seat; 
39:36 the table, all its vessels, and the showbread; 
39:37 the pure lampstand, its lamps, even the lamps to be set in order, and all its vessels, and the oil for the light; 
39:38 and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the Tent; 
39:39 the bronze altar, and its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its vessels, the basin and its base; 
39:40 the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, its cords, and its pins, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting; 
39:41 the finely wrought garments for ministering in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to serve in the priest's office. 
39:42 According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did all the work. 
39:43 And Moses saw all the work, and, look, they had done it; as Yahweh had commanded, even so they had done it: and Moses blessed them.
40:1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
40:2 On the first day of the first month you will rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. 
40:3 And you will put in it the ark of the testimony, and you will screen the ark with the veil. 
40:4 And you will bring in the table, and set in order the things that are on it; and you will bring in the lampstand, and light its lamps. 
40:5 And you will set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 
40:6 And you will set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. 
40:7 And you will set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and will put water in it. 
40:8 And you will set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court. 
40:9 And you will take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and will hallow it, and all its furniture: and it will be holy. 
40:10 And you will anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar will be most holy. 
40:11 And you will anoint the basin and its base, and sanctify it. 
40:12 And you will bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of meeting, and will wash them with water. 
40:13 And you will put on Aaron the holy garments; and you will anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may serve me in the priest's office. 
40:14 And you will bring his sons, and put coats on them; 
40:15 and you will anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may serve me in the priest's office: and their anointing will be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. 
40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that Yahweh commanded him, so he did.
40:17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. 
40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and reared up its pillars. 
40:19 And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above on it; as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above on the ark: 
40:21 and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
40:22 And he put the table in the tent of meeting, on the side of the tabernacle northward, outside the veil. 
40:23 And he set the bread in order on it before Yahweh; as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
40:24 And he put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, across from the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
40:25 And he lit the lamps before Yahweh; as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
40:26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil: 
40:27 and he burned on it incense of sweet spices; as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
40:28 And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 
40:29 And he set the altar of burnt-offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering; as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
40:30 And he set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it, with which to wash. 
40:31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet from it; 
40:32 when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed; as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
40:34 Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Yahweh filled the tabernacle. 
40:35 And Moses wasn't able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and the glory of Yahweh filled the tabernacle. 
40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys: 
40:37 but if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't journey until the day that it was taken up. 
40:38 For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
