1:1 In the beginning was the Speech, and the Speech was with God, and the Speech was God. 
1:2 The same was in the beginning with God. 
1:3 All things came into existence through him; and without him nothing came into existence. That which has come to exist 
1:4 in him was life; and the life was the light of men. 
1:5 And the light shines in the darkness; and the darkness did not apprehend it. 
1:6 There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John. 
1:7 The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him. 
1:8 He was not the light, but [came] that he might bear witness of the light. 
1:9 There was the true light, which lights every man, coming into the world. 
1:10 He was in the world, and the world came into existence through him, and the world did not know him. 
1:11 He came to his own, and those who were his own did not receive him. 
1:12 But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become sons of God, to those who believe on his name: 
1:13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
1:14 And the Speech became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw his glory, glory as an only begotten from a father, full of grace and truth. 
1:15 John bears witness of him, and cries out, saying, This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me has become ahead of me: for he was before me. 
1:16 For of his fullness we all received, and grace for grace. 
1:17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
1:18 No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared [him].
1:19 And this is the witness of John, when the Jews from Jerusalem sent to him priests and Levites to ask him, Who are you? 
1:20 And he confessed, and did not deny; and he confessed, I am not the Christ. 
1:21 And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you the prophet? And he answered, No. 
1:22 They said therefore to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say of yourself? 
1:23 He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of Yahweh, as Isaiah the prophet said. 
1:24 And they had been sent from the Pharisees. 
1:25 And they asked him, and said to him, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet? 
1:26 John answered them, saying, I baptize in water. Among you<sup><small>+</small></sup> stands one whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't know, 
1:27 [even] he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose. 
1:28 These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
1:29 On the next day he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 
1:30 This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who has become ahead of me: for he was before me. 
1:31 And I didn't know him; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause I came baptizing in water. 
1:32 And John bore witness, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it stayed on him. 
1:33 And I didn't know him: but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and staying on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit. 
1:34 And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.
1:35 Again on the next day John was standing, and two of his disciples; 
1:36 and he looked on Jesus as he walked, and says, Look, the Lamb of God! 
1:37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 
1:38 And Jesus turned, and looked at them following, and says to them, What do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> seek? And they said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where do you stay? 
1:39 He says to them, Come, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will see. They came therefore and saw where he stayed; and they stayed with him that day: it was about the tenth hour. 
1:40 One of the two who heard John [speak], and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 
1:41 He finds first his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ). 
1:42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked on him, and said, You are Simon the son of John: you will be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).
1:43 On the next day he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he finds Philip: and Jesus says to him, Follow me. 
1:44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. 
1:45 Philip finds Nathaniel, and says to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. 
1:46 And Nathaniel said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see. 
1:47 Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him, and says of him, Look, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! 
1:48 Nathaniel says to him, From where do you know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you. 
1:49 Nathaniel answered him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are King of Israel. 
1:50 Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you underneath the fig tree, you believe? You will see greater things than these. 
1:51 And he says to him, Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.
2:1 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: 
2:2 and Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the marriage. 
2:3 And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine. 
2:4 And Jesus says to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? My hour is not yet come. 
2:5 His mother says to the servants, Whatever he says to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, do it. 
2:6 Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing about twenty or thirty gallons each. 
2:7 Jesus says to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 
2:8 And he says to them, Draw out now, and bear to the ruler of the feast. And they bore it. 
2:9 And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn't know from where it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calls the bridegroom, 
2:10 and says to him, Every man sets on first the good wine; and when [men] have drank freely, [then] that which is worse: you have kept the good wine until now. 
2:11 This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him. 
2:12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples; and they did not stay there many days.
2:13 And the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
2:14 And he found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: 
2:15 and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables; 
2:16 and to those who sold the doves he said, Take these things from here; don't make my Father's house a house of merchandise. 
2:17 His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for your house will eat me up. 
2:18 The Jews therefore answered and said to him, What sign do you show to us, seeing that you do these things? 
2:19 Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. 
2:20 The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days? 
2:21 But he spoke of the temple of his body. 
2:22 When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spoke this; and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
2:23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, watching his signs which he did. 
2:24 But Jesus did not trust himself to them, for that he knew all men, 
2:25 and because he did not need that anyone should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.
3:1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: 
3:2 the same came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do, except God be with him. 
3:3 Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except one be born anew, he can't see the kingdom of God. 
3:4 Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born? 
3:5 Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except one be born of water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 
3:6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. 
3:7 Do not marvel that I said to you, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> must be born anew. 
3:8 The wind blows where it will, and you hear its voice, but do not know from where it comes, and where it goes: so is everyone who is born of the Spirit. 
3:9 Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be? 
3:10 Jesus answered and said to him, Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things? 
3:11 Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not receive our witness. 
3:12 If I told you<sup><small>+</small></sup> earthly things and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not believe, how will you<sup><small>+</small></sup> believe if I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup> heavenly things? 
3:13 And no one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man. 
3:14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; 
3:15 that whoever believes may in him have eternal life.
3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes on him should not perish, but have eternal life. 
3:17 For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him. 
3:18 He who believes on him is not judged: but he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God. 
3:19 And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil. 
3:20 For everyone who participates in evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works should be reproved. 
3:21 But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been worked in God.
3:22 After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea; and there he spent some time with them, and baptized. 
3:23 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. 
3:24 For John was not yet cast into prison.
3:25 There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purifying. 
3:26 And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have borne witness, look, the same baptizes, and all men come to him. 
3:27 John answered and said, A man cannot receive anything, except it has been given him from heaven. 
3:28 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him. 
3:29 He who has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is made full. 
3:30 He must increase, but I must decrease.
3:31 He who comes from above is above all: he who is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaks: he who comes from heaven is above all. 
3:32 What he has seen and heard, of that he bears witness; and no man receives his witness. 
3:33 He who has received his witness has set his seal to [this], that God is true. 
3:34 For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for he does not give the Spirit by measure. 
3:35 The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand. 
3:36 He who believes on the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God stays on him.
4:1 But when Jesus knew that many Pharisees heard that he was making many disciples, [even] more than John, 
4:2 because it was not Jesus alone who was baptizing but [also] his disciples, 
4:3 he left Judea and departed again into Galilee. 
4:4 And he must surely pass through Samaria.
4:5 So he comes to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph: 
4:6 and Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. 
4:7 There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus says to her, Give me a drink. 
4:8 For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. 
4:9 The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask me for a drink, being a Samaritan woman? For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans. 
4:10 Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give me a drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water. 
4:11 The woman says to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where then do you have that living water? 
4:12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle? 
4:13 Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again: 
4:14 but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of living water forever. 
4:15 The woman says to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, neither come all the way here to draw.
4:16 He says to her, Go, call your husband, and come here. 
4:17 The woman answered and said to him, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, You said well, I have no husband: 
4:18 for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband: this you have said truly. 
4:19 The woman says to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. 
4:20 Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
4:21 Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you<sup><small>+</small></sup> worship the Father. 
4:22 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> worship that which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't know: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews. 
4:23 But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such does the Father seek to be his worshipers. 
4:24 God is spirit: and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth. 
4:25 The woman says to him, I know that Messiah comes (he who is called Christ): when he has come, he will declare to us all things. 
4:26 Jesus says to her, I am he who speaks to you.
4:27 And on this his disciples came; and they marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What do you seek? Or, Why do you speak with her? 
4:28 So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and says to the men, 
4:29 Come, see a man, who told me all things that I ever did: can this be the Christ? 
4:30 They went out of the city, and were coming to him.
4:31 In the meanwhile the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat. 
4:32 But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not know. 
4:33 The disciples therefore said one to another, Has any man brought him [anything] to eat? 
4:34 Jesus says to them, My meat is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work. 
4:35 Don't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, There are yet four months, and [then] comes the harvest? Look, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Lift up your<sup><small>+</small></sup> eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white to harvest. 
4:36 Already he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together. 
4:37 For in this is the saying true, One sows, and another reaps. 
4:38 I sent you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to reap that for which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have not labored: others have labored, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have entered into their labor.
4:39 And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that [ever] I did. 
4:40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they implored him to stay with them: and he stayed there two days. 
4:41 And many more believed because of his word; 
4:42 and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.
4:43 And after the two days he went forth from there into Galilee. 
4:44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country. 
4:45 So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.
4:46 He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 
4:47 When he heard that Jesus came out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and implored [him] that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. 
4:48 Jesus therefore said to him, Except you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see signs and wonders, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will in no way believe. 
4:49 The nobleman says to him, Sir, come down before my child dies. 
4:50 Jesus says to him, Go your way; your son lives. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. 
4:51 And as he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying, that his boy lived. 
4:52 So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 
4:53 So the father knew that [it was] at that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives: and himself believed, and his whole house. 
4:54 Now this is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.
5:1 After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
5:2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep [gate] a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethzatha, having five porches. 
5:3 In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, [and] withered.
5:5 And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity. 
5:6 When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been [sick] now a long time, he says to him, Do you want to be made whole? 
5:7 The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me. 
5:8 Jesus says to him, Arise, take up your bed, and walk. 
5:9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day. 
5:10 So the Jews said to him who was cured, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed. 
5:11 But he answered them, He who made me whole, the same said to me, Take up your bed, and walk. 
5:12 They asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up [your bed], and walk? 
5:13 But he who was healed did not know who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place. 
5:14 After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Look, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall you. 
5:15 The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole. 
5:16 And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the Sabbath. 
5:17 But Jesus answered them, My Father works even until now, and I work. 
5:18 For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
5:19 Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing: for whatever things he does, these the Son also does in like manner. 
5:20 For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and greater works than these he will show him, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may marvel. 
5:21 For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he will. 
5:22 For neither does the Father judge any man, but he has given all judgment to the Son; 
5:23 that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
5:24 Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, He who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life. 
5:25 Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, The hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live. 
5:26 For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself: 
5:27 and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is Son of Man. 
5:28 Don't marvel at this: for the hour comes, in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice, 
5:29 and will come forth; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have participated in evil, to the resurrection of judgment. 
5:30 I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I don't seek my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
5:31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 
5:32 It is another who bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true. 
5:33 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. 
5:34 But the witness which I receive is not from man: nevertheless I say these things, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may live. 
5:35 He was the lamp that burns and shines; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were willing to rejoice for a season in his light. 
5:36 But the witness which I have is greater than [that of] John; for the works which the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me. 
5:37 And the Father who sent me, he has borne witness of me. You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form. 
5:38 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not have his word staying in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: for whom he sent, him you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not believe. 
5:39 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> search the Scriptures, because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> think that in them you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have eternal life; and those are the ones which bear witness of me; 
5:40 and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not come to me, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may have life.
5:41 I do not receive glory from men. 
5:42 But I know you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not have the love of God in yourselves. 
5:43 I have come in my Father's name, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not receive me: if another will come in his own name, him you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will receive. 
5:44 How can you<sup><small>+</small></sup> believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that [comes] from the only God, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not seek? 
5:45 Do not think that I will accuse you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to the Father: there is one who accuses you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, [even] Moses, on whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have set your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hope. 
5:46 For if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> believed Moses, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would believe me; for he wrote of me. 
5:47 But if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not believe his writings, how will you<sup><small>+</small></sup> believe my words?
6:1 After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is [the sea] of Tiberias. 
6:2 And a great multitude followed him, because they were watching the signs which he did on those who were sick. 
6:3 And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 
6:4 Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.
6:5 Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude comes to him, says to Philip, From where are we to buy bread, that these may eat? 
6:6 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. 
6:7 Philip answered him, 200 denarii of bread is not sufficient for them, that each may take a little. 
6:8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him, 
6:9 There is a lad here, who has five barley loaves, and two fish: but what are these among so many? 
6:10 Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 
6:11 Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to those who were set down; likewise also of the fish as much as they would. 
6:12 And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be lost. 
6:13 So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over to those who had eaten. 
6:14 When therefore the men saw the sign which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet who comes into the world. 
6:15 Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain himself alone.
6:16 And when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea; 
6:17 and they entered into a boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. 
6:18 And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew. 
6:19 When therefore they had rowed about three or three and a half miles, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat: and they were afraid. 
6:20 But he says to them, It is I; don't be afraid. 
6:21 They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat: and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.
6:22 On the next day the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except one, and that Jesus didn't enter with his disciples into the boat, but [that] his disciples went away alone. 
6:23 Other boats came from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 
6:24 When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. 
6:25 And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when did you come here?
6:26 Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> seek me, not because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> saw signs, but because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> ate of the loaves, and were filled. 
6:27 Don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food which stays alive forever, which the Son of Man will give to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: for him the Father, [even] God, has sealed. 
6:28 They said therefore to him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God? 
6:29 Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> believe on him whom he has sent.
6:30 They said therefore to him, What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do? 
6:31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. 
6:32 Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Has not Moses given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the bread out of heaven? But my Father gives you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the true bread out of heaven. 
6:33 For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world. 
6:34 They said therefore to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. 
6:35 Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he who comes to me will not hunger, and he who believes on me will never thirst.
6:36 But I said to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have seen me, and yet do not believe. 
6:37 All that which the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will in no way cast out. 
6:38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me. 
6:39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that of all that which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up on the last day. 
6:40 For this is the will of my Father, that everyone looking at the Son, and believing on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day.
6:41 The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven. 
6:42 And they said, Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, I have come down out of heaven? 
6:43 Jesus answered and said to them, Do not murmur among yourselves. 
6:44 No man can come to me, except the Father who sent me draws him: and I will raise him up in the last day. 
6:45 It is written in the prophets, And they will all be taught of God. Everyone who has heard from the Father, and has learned, comes to me. 
6:46 Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God, he has seen the Father. 
6:47 Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, He who believes has eternal life. 
6:48 I am the bread of life. 
6:49 Your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. 
6:50 This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die. 
6:51 I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eats of this bread, he will live forever: yes and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.
6:52 The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? 
6:53 Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Except you<sup><small>+</small></sup> eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't have life in yourselves. 
6:54 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. 
6:55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 
6:56 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood stays in me, and I in him. 
6:57 As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who eats of me, he also will live because of me. 
6:58 This is the bread which came down out of heaven: not as the fathers ate, and died; he who eats this bread will live forever. 
6:59 These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
6:60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard [this], said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it? 
6:61 But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, Does this cause you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to stumble? 
6:62 [What] then if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> should see the Son of Man ascending where he was before? 
6:63 It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I have spoken to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are spirit, and are life. 
6:64 But there are some of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe, and who it was that should deliver him up. 
6:65 And he said, For this cause I have said to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that no man can come to me, except it is given to him of the Father.
6:66 On this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. 
6:67 Jesus said therefore to the twelve, Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also want to go away? 
6:68 Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the word of eternal life. 
6:69 And we have believed and know that you are the Holy One of God. 
6:70 Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the twelve, and one of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> is the devil? 
6:71 Now he spoke of Judas [the son] of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who should deliver him up, [being] one of the twelve.
7:1 And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. 
7:2 Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand. 
7:3 His brothers therefore said to him, Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do. 
7:4 For no man does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, manifest yourself to the world. 
7:5 For even his brothers did not believe on him. 
7:6 Jesus therefore says to them, My time is not yet come; but your<sup><small>+</small></sup> time is always ready. 
7:7 The world can't hate you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that its works are evil. 
7:8 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> go up to the feast: I do not go up to this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled. 
7:9 And having said these things, he stayed in Galilee.
7:10 But when his brothers went up to the feast, then he went up also, not publicly, but as it were in secret. 
7:11 The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 
7:12 And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; but others said, Not so, but he leads the multitude astray. 
7:13 Yet no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.
7:14 But when the feast was already halfway through, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. 
7:15 The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How does this man know letters, having never learned? 
7:16 Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me. 
7:17 If any man wills to do his will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or [whether] I speak from myself. 
7:18 He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory: but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. 
7:19 Has not Moses given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the law? And [yet] none of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> does the law. Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> seek to kill me? 
7:20 The multitude answered, You have a demon: who seeks to kill you? 
7:21 Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and all of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> marvel because of it. 
7:22 Moses has given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> circumcision--not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers--and on the Sabbath you<sup><small>+</small></sup> circumcise a man. 
7:23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> angry with me, because I made a man every bit whole on the Sabbath? 
7:24 Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
7:25 Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Isn't this he whom they seek to kill? 
7:26 And look, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ? 
7:27 Nevertheless we know this man from where he is: but when the Christ comes, no one knows from where he is. 
7:28 Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> both know me, and know from where I am; and I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't know. 
7:29 I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me. 
7:30 They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come. 
7:31 But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ will come, will he do more signs than those which this man has done? 
7:32 The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent attendants to take him. 
7:33 Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while I am with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and I go to him who sent me. 
7:34 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> cannot come. 
7:35 The Jews therefore said among themselves, Where will this man go that we will not find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? 
7:36 What is this word that he said, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will seek me, and will not find me; and where I am, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> cannot come?
7:40 [Some] of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet. 
7:41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, does the Christ come out of Galilee? 
7:42 Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was? 
7:43 So there arose a division in the multitude because of him. 
7:44 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
7:45 The attendants therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why didn't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> bring him? 
7:46 The attendants answered, Never did man so speak. 
7:47 The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also led astray? 
7:48 Has any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees? 
7:49 But this multitude that doesn't know the law are accursed. 
7:50 Nicodemus, he who came to him before, being one of them, says to them, 
7:51 Does our law judge a man, except it first hear from him and know what he does? 
7:52 They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee rises no prophet.
8:1 []
8:12 Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life. 
8:13 The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bear witness of yourself; your witness is not true. 
8:14 Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know from where I came, and where I go; but you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't know from where I come, or where I go. 
8:15 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> judge after the flesh; I judge no man. 
8:16 Yes and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me. 
8:17 Yes and in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> law it is written, that the witness of two men is true. 
8:18 I am he who bears witness of myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness of me. 
8:19 They said therefore to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> know neither me, nor my Father: if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> knew me, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would know my Father also. 
8:20 These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.
8:21 He said therefore again to them, I go away, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will seek me, and will die in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sin: where I go, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> can't come. 
8:22 The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he says, Where I go, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> can't come? 
8:23 And he said to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are from beneath; I am from above: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are of this world; I am not of this world. 
8:24 I said therefore to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will die in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sins: for except you<sup><small>+</small></sup> believe that I am [he], you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will die in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sins. 
8:25 They said therefore to him, Who are you? Jesus said to them, Even that which I have also spoken to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> from the beginning. 
8:26 I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: nevertheless he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I speak to the world. 
8:27 They didn't perceive that he spoke to them of the Father. 
8:28 Jesus therefore said to them, When you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have lifted up the Son of Man, then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things. 
8:29 And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.
8:30 As he spoke these things, many believed on him. 
8:31 Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> stay in my word, [then] you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are truly my disciples; 
8:32 and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will know the truth, and the truth will make you<sup><small>+</small></sup> free.
8:33 They answered to him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never yet served as any man's slaves: how do you say, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be made free? 
8:34 Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin. 
8:35 And the slave doesn't stay in the house forever: the son stays forever. 
8:36 If therefore the Son will make you<sup><small>+</small></sup> free, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be free indeed. 
8:37 I know that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are Abraham's seed; yet you<sup><small>+</small></sup> seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
8:38 I speak the things which I have seen from the Father. And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> therefore, [should] do the things which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> heard from the Father.
8:39 They answered and said to him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus says to them, If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were Abraham's children, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would be doing the works of Abraham. 
8:40 But now you<sup><small>+</small></sup> seek to kill me, a man who has told you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the truth, which I heard from God: Abraham did not do this. 
8:41 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> do the works of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> father. Therefore they said to him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God. 
8:42 Jesus said to them, If God were your<sup><small>+</small></sup> Father, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would love me: for I came forth and have come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me. 
8:43 Why don't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> understand my speech? [Even] because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> can't hear my word. 
8:44 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are of the father the devil, and the desires of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> father it is your<sup><small>+</small></sup> will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and did not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of lies. 
8:45 But because I say the truth, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't believe me. 
8:46 Which of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> convicts me of sin? If I say truth, why don't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> believe me? 
8:47 He who is of God hears the words of God: for this cause you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not hear [them], because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are not of God.
8:48 The Jews answered and said to him, Do we not say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon? 
8:49 Jesus answered, I do not have a demon; but I honor my Father, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> dishonor me. 
8:50 But I don't seek my own glory: there is one who seeks and judges. 
8:51 Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, If a man keeps my word, he will never see death. 
8:52 Therefore the Jews said to him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death. 
8:53 Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died: whom do you make yourself? 
8:54 Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who glorifies me; of whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, He is our God; 
8:55 and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I don't know him, I will be like you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word. 
8:56 Your<sup><small>+</small></sup> father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad. 
8:57 The Jews therefore said to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham? 
8:58 Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Before Abraham was born, I am. 
8:59 They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.
9:1 And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth. 
9:2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind? 
9:3 Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 
9:4 We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work. 
9:5 When I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 
9:6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay, 
9:7 and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
9:8 The neighbors therefore, and those who saw him previously, that he was a beggar, said, Isn't this he who sat and begged? 
9:9 Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am [he]. 
9:10 They said therefore to him, How then were your eyes opened? 
9:11 He answered, The man who is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight. 
9:12 And they said to him, Where is he? He says, I don't know.
9:13 They bring to the Pharisees him who previously was blind. 
9:14 Now it was the Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 
9:15 Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see. 
9:16 Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them. 
9:17 They say therefore to the blind man again, What do you say of him, in that he opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.
9:18 The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight, 
9:19 and asked them, saying, Is this your<sup><small>+</small></sup> son, who you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say was born blind? How then does he now see? 
9:20 His parents therefore answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: 
9:21 but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened his eyes, we don't know: ask him; he is of age; he will speak for himself. 
9:22 These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him [to be] Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. 
9:23 Therefore his parents said, He is of age; ask him.
9:24 So they called a second time the man who was blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner. 
9:25 He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I don't know: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. 
9:26 They said therefore to him, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes? 
9:27 He answered them, I told you<sup><small>+</small></sup> even now, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not hear; why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> want to hear it again? Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also want to become his disciples? 
9:28 And they reviled him, and said, You are his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses. 
9:29 We know that God has spoken to Moses: but as for this man, we don't know where he is from. 
9:30 The man answered and said to them, Therefore, in this is the marvel, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't know where he is from, and [yet] he opened my eyes. 
9:31 We know that God does not hear sinners: but if any man is a worshiper of God, and does his will, him he hears. 
9:32 Never was it heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. 
9:33 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. 
9:34 They answered and said to him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.
9:35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Do you believe in the Son of Man? 
9:36 He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? 
9:37 Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you. 
9:38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him. 
9:39 And Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, that those who don't see may see; and that those who see may become blind. 
9:40 Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, Are we also blind? 
9:41 Jesus said to them, If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were blind, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would have no sin: but now you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, We see: your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sin stays.
10:1 Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, He who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. 
10:2 But he who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 
10:3 To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. 
10:4 When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. 
10:5 And a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him: for they don't know the voice of strangers. 
10:6 This parable Jesus spoke to them: but they didn't understand what things they were which he spoke to them.
10:7 Jesus therefore said again, Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I am the door of the sheep. 
10:8 All who came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. 
10:9 I am the door; by me if any man enters in, he will live, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture. 
10:10 The thief does not come, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have [it] abundantly. 
10:11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his soul for the sheep. 
10:12 He who is a hired worker, and not a shepherd, whose sheep are not his own, watches the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees, and the wolf snatches them, and scatters [them]: 
10:13 [he flees] because he is a hired worker, and does not care for the sheep. 
10:14 I am the good shepherd; and I know my own, and my own know me, 
10:15 even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my soul for the sheep. 
10:16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: I must also bring them, and they will hear my voice; and they will become one flock, one shepherd. 
10:17 Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my soul, that I may take it again. 
10:18 No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment I received from my Father.
10:19 There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words. 
10:20 And many of them said, He has a demon, and is insane; why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hear him? 
10:21 Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
10:22 Then came the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, 
10:23 and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch. 
10:24 The Jews therefore came around him, and said to him, How long do you take away our soul in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly. 
10:25 Jesus answered them, I told you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not believe: the works that I do in my Father's name, these bear witness of me. 
10:26 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not believe, because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are not of my sheep. 
10:27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: 
10:28 and I give to them eternal life; and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. 
10:29 What my Father has given to me is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch out of the Father's hand. 
10:30 I and the Father are one.
10:31 The Jews took up stones again to stone him. 
10:32 Jesus answered them, Many good works I have shown you<sup><small>+</small></sup> from the Father; for which of those works do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> stone me? 
10:33 The Jews answered him, For a good work we don't stone you, but for blasphemy; and because you, being a man, make yourself God. 
10:34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> law, I said, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are gods? 
10:35 If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can't be broken), 
10:36 do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am [the] Son of God? 
10:37 If I don't do the works of my Father, don't believe me. 
10:38 But if I do them, though you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't believe me, believe the works: that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father. 
10:39 Therefore they sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.
10:40 And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there he stayed. 
10:41 And many came to him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatever John spoke of this man were true. 
10:42 And many believed on him there.
11:1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 
11:2 And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. 
11:3 The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, look, he whom you love is sick. 
11:4 But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it. 
11:5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 
11:6 When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed at that time two days in the place where he was. 
11:7 Then after this he says to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again. 
11:8 The disciples say to him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone you; and do you go there again? 
11:9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. 
11:10 But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.
11:11 These things he spoke: and after this he says to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. 
11:12 The disciples therefore said to him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover. 
11:13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep. 
11:14 Then Jesus therefore said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 
11:15 And I am glad for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sakes that I was not there, to the intent you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may believe; nevertheless let us go to him. 
11:16 Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
11:17 So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days' [time] already. 
11:18 Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about two miles away; 
11:19 and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. 
11:20 Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house. 
11:21 Martha therefore said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 
11:22 And even now I know that, whatever you will ask of God, God will give you. 
11:23 Jesus says to her, Your brother will rise again. 
11:24 Martha says to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day. 
11:25 Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he who believes on me, though he dies, yet he will live; 
11:26 and whoever lives and believes on me will never die. Do you believe this? 
11:27 She says to him, Yes, Lord: I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, [even] he who comes into the world.
11:28 And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calls you. 
11:29 And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went to him. 
11:30 (Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.) 
11:31 The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
11:32 Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 
11:33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews [also] weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, 
11:34 and said, Where have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see. 
11:35 Jesus wept. 
11:36 The Jews therefore said, Look at how he loved him! 
11:37 But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have caused that this man also should not die?
11:38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 
11:39 Jesus says, Take<sup><small>+</small></sup> away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was dead, says to him, Lord, by this time the body decays; for he has been [dead] four days' [time]. 
11:40 Jesus says to her, Did I not say to you, that, if you believed, you should see the glory of God? 
11:41 So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you heard me. 
11:42 And I knew that you hear me always: but because of the multitude that stands around I said it, that they may believe that you sent me. 
11:43 And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. 
11:44 He who was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and let him go.
11:45 Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw that which he did, believed on him. 
11:46 But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done. 
11:47 The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a Sanhedrin, and said, What do we do? This man does many signs. 
11:48 If we leave him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation. 
11:49 But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> know nothing at all, 
11:50 nor do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> take account that it is expedient for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish. 
11:51 Now this he did not say of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation; 
11:52 and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. 
11:53 So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death. 
11:54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he stayed with the disciples.
11:55 Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover, to purify themselves. 
11:56 They sought therefore for Jesus, and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, What do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> think? That he will not come to the feast? 
11:57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.
12:1 Jesus therefore six days before the Passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead. 
12:2 So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of those who sat to eat with him.
12:3 Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. 
12:4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should deliver him up, says, 
12:5 Why wasn't this ointment sold for 300 denarii, and given to the poor? 
12:6 Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put in it. 
12:7 Jesus therefore said, Allow her to keep it against the day of my burying. 
12:8 For the poor you<sup><small>+</small></sup> always have with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; but me you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not always have.
12:9 The large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 
12:10 But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death; 
12:11 because by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
12:12 On the next day the great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
12:13 took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed [is] he who comes, the King of Israel, in the name of Yahweh.
12:14 And Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written, 
12:15 Don't be afraid, daughter of Zion: look, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt. 
12:16 These things his disciples did not understand at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him. 
12:17 The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bore witness. 
12:18 For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign. 
12:19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Look at how you<sup><small>+</small></sup> prevail nothing: look, the world has gone after him.
12:20 Now there were certain Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast: 
12:21 these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus. 
12:22 Philip comes and tells Andrew: Andrew comes, and Philip, and they tell Jesus. 
12:23 And Jesus answers them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of Man should be glorified. 
12:24 Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Except a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it stays alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. 
12:25 He who loves his soul loses it; and he who hates his soul in this world will keep it to eternal life. 
12:26 If any man serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there will also my servant be: if any man serves me, the Father will honor him.
12:27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came to this hour. 
12:28 Father, glorify your name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, [saying,] I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. 
12:29 The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel has spoken to him. 
12:30 Jesus answered and said, This voice has not come for my sake, but for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sakes. 
12:31 Now is the judgment of this world: now will the prince of this world be cast out. 
12:32 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself. 
12:33 But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.
12:34 The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ stays forever: and how do you say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man? 
12:35 Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while is the light among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. Walk while you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have the light, that darkness does not overtake you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: and he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. 
12:36 While you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have the light, believe on the light, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may become sons of light. These things Jesus spoke, and he departed and hid himself from them.
12:37 But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they didn't believe on him: 
12:38 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?" 
12:39 For this cause they could not believe, for Isaiah said again, 
12:40 "He has blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them." 
12:41 Isaiah said these things, because he saw his glory; and he spoke of him. 
12:42 Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [it], lest they should be put out of the synagogue: 
12:43 for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
12:44 And Jesus cried and said, He who believes on me, does not believe on me, but on him who sent me. 
12:45 And he who looks at me looks at him who sent me. 
12:46 I have come a light into the world, that whoever believes on me may not stay in the darkness. 
12:47 And if any man hears my sayings, and does not keep them, I do not judge him: for I didn't come to judge the world, but to save the world. 
12:48 He who rejects me, and does not receive my sayings, has one who judges him: the word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day. 
12:49 For I did not speak from myself; but the Father who sent me, he has given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. 
12:50 And I know that his commandment is eternal life: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak.
13:1 Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that his hour came that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. 
13:2 And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas [the son] of Simon Iscariot, to deliver him up, 
13:3 [Jesus], knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and goes to God, 
13:4 rises from supper, and lays aside his garments; and he took a towel, and girded himself. 
13:5 Then he pours water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. 
13:6 So he comes to Simon Peter. He says to him, Lord, do you wash my feet? 
13:7 Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you don't know now; but you will understand hereafter. 
13:8 Peter says to him, You will never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I don't wash you, you have no part with me. 
13:9 Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. 
13:10 Jesus says to him, He who is bathed doesn't need to wash except for the feet, but is clean every bit: and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are clean, but not all. 
13:11 For he knew him who should deliver him up; therefore he said, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are not all clean.
13:12 So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said to them, Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know what I have done to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? 
13:13 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> call me, The Teacher, and, The Lord: and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say well; for so I am. 
13:14 If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your<sup><small>+</small></sup> feet, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also ought to wash one another's feet. 
13:15 For I have given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> an example, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also should do as I have done to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
13:16 Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, A slave is not greater than his lord; neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him. 
13:17 If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know these things, blessed are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do them. 
13:18 I don't speak of all of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: I know whom I have chosen: but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He who eats my bread lifted up his heel against me. 
13:19 From now on I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup> before it comes to pass, that, when it has come to pass, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may believe that I am [he]. 
13:20 Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, He who receives whomever I send receives me; and he who receives me receives him who sent me.
13:21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that one of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will deliver me up. 
13:22 The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke. 
13:23 There was at the table reclining in Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 
13:24 Simon Peter therefore beckons to him, to ask who it might be that he is talking about. 
13:25 Therefore leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' breast, says to him, Lord, who is it? 
13:26 Jesus answers, It is he, for whom I will dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he takes and gives it to Judas, [the son] of Simon Iscariot. 
13:27 And after the sop, then Satan entered into him. Jesus therefore says to him, What you do, do quickly. 
13:28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him. 
13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. 
13:30 He then having received the sop went out right away: and it was night.
13:31 When therefore he had gone out, Jesus says, Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him; 
13:32 If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and right away he will glorify him. 
13:33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> can't come; so now I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
13:34 A new commandment I give to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> love one another; even as I have loved you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also love one another. 
13:35 By this will all men know that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are my disciples, if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have love one to another.
13:36 Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where do you go? Jesus answered him, Where I go, you can't follow me now; but you will follow afterward. 
13:37 Peter says to him, Lord, why can't I follow you even now? I will lay down my soul for you. 
13:38 Jesus answers, Will you lay down your soul for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, The rooster will not crow, until you have denied me thrice.
14:1 Don't let your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in me. 
14:2 In my Father's house are many places to stay; if it were not so, would I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup> that I go to prepare a place for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? 
14:3 And if I go and prepare a place for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I come again, and will receive you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to myself; that where I am, [there] you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may be also. 
14:4 And where I go, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know the way. 
14:5 Thomas says to him, Lord, we don't know where you are going; how can we know the way? 
14:6 Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one comes to the Father, but by me. 
14:7 If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have known me, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will also know my Father: and from now on you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know him, and have seen him. 
14:8 Philip says to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffices us. 
14:9 Jesus says to him, Have I been so long time with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and don't you know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father; how do you say, Show us the Father? 
14:10 Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> I don't speak from myself: but the Father staying in me does his works. 
14:11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: otherwise believe for the very works' sake. 
14:12 Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, He who believes on me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater [works] than these he will do; because I go to the Father. 
14:13 And whatever you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 
14:14 If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will ask me anything in my name, I will do [it].
14:15 If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> love me, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will keep my commandments. 
14:16 And I will pray the Father, and he will give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> another Supporter, that he may be with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> forever, 
14:17 [even] the Spirit of truth: whom the world can't receive; for it does not see him, neither knows him: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know him; for he stays with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and will be in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
14:18 I will not leave you<sup><small>+</small></sup> desolate: I come to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
14:19 Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see me: because I live, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will live also. 
14:20 In that day you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will know that I am in my Father, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in me, and I in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
14:21 He who has my commandments, and keeps them, it is he who loves me: and he who loves me will be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. 
14:22 Judas (not Iscariot) says to him, Lord, and what has come to pass that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world? 
14:23 Jesus answered and said to him, If a man loves me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make a place to stay with him. 
14:24 He who does not love me does not keep my words: and the word which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.
14:25 These things I have spoken to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, while [yet] staying with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
14:26 But the Spirit, the Supporter, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you<sup><small>+</small></sup> all things, and bring to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> remembrance all that I said to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
14:27 Peace I leave with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; my peace I give to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: not as the world gives, I give to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. Don't let your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. 
14:28 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> heard how I said to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I go away, and I come to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> loved me, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I. 
14:29 And now I have told you<sup><small>+</small></sup> before it comes to pass, that, when it has come to pass, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may believe. 
14:30 I will no more speak much with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, for the prince of the world comes: and he has nothing in me; 
14:31 but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here.
15:1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 
15:2 Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes it away: and every [branch] that bears fruit, he cleanses it, that it may bear more fruit. 
15:3 Already you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are clean because of the word which I have spoken to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
15:4 Stay in me, and I in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. As the branch can't bear fruit of itself, except it stays in the vine; so neither can you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, except you<sup><small>+</small></sup> stay in me. 
15:5 I am the vine, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are the branches: He who stays in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit: for apart from me you<sup><small>+</small></sup> can do nothing. 
15:6 If a man does not stay in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. 
15:7 If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> stay in me, and my words stay in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, ask whatever you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will, and it will be done to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
15:8 In this is my Father glorified, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may bear much fruit and may be my disciples. 
15:9 Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: stay<sup><small>+</small></sup> in my love. 
15:10 If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> keep my commandments, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will stay in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and stay in his love.
15:11 These things I have spoken to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that my joy may be in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and [that] your<sup><small>+</small></sup> joy may be made full. 
15:12 This is my commandment, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> love one another, even as I have loved you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
15:13 Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 
15:14 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are my friends, if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do the things which I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
15:15 No longer do I call you<sup><small>+</small></sup> slaves; for the slave doesn't know what his lord does: but I have called you<sup><small>+</small></sup> friends; for all things that I heard from my Father I have made known to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
15:16 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not choose me, but I chose you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and appointed you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> should go and bear fruit, and [that] your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fruit should stay: that whatever you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
15:17 These things I command you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may love one another.
15:18 If the world hates you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know that it has hated me before [it hated] you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
15:19 If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> were of the world, the world would love its own: but because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are not of the world, but I chose you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out of the world, therefore the world hates you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
15:20 Remember the word that I said to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, A slave is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; if they kept my word, they will keep yours<sup><small>+</small></sup> also. 
15:21 But all these things they will do to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> for my name's sake, because they don't know him who sent me. 
15:22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin. 
15:23 He who hates me hates my Father also. 
15:24 If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin: but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father. 
15:25 But [this comes to pass], that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
15:26 When the Supporter has come, whom I will send to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness of me: 
15:27 and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also bear witness, because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have been with me from the beginning.
16:1 These things I have spoken to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> should not be caused to stumble. 
16:2 They will put you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out of the synagogues: yes, the hour comes, that whoever kills you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will think that he offers service to God. 
16:3 And these things they will do, because they haven't known the Father, nor me. 
16:4 But these things I have spoken to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that when their hour has come, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may remember them, how that I told you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. And these things I didn't say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> from the beginning, because I was with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
16:5 But now I go to him who sent me; and none of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> asks me, Where do you go? 
16:6 But because I have spoken these things to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, sorrow has filled your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart. 
16:7 Nevertheless I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the truth: It is expedient for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> that I go away; for if I don't go away, the Supporter will not come to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; but if I go, I will send him to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
16:8 And he, when he has come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: 
16:9 of sin, because they do not believe on me; 
16:10 of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see me no more; 
16:11 of judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.
16:12 I have yet many things to say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, but you<sup><small>+</small></sup> can't bear them now. 
16:13 Nevertheless when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you<sup><small>+</small></sup> into all the truth: for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he will hear, he will speak: and he will declare to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the things that are to come. 
16:14 He will glorify me: for he will take of mine, and will declare [it] to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
16:15 All things that the Father has are mine: therefore I said, that he takes of mine, and will declare [it] to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
16:16 A little while, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see me no more; and again a little while, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will see me. 
16:17 [Some] of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he says to us, A little while, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't see me; and again a little while, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will see me: and, Because I go to the Father? 
16:18 They said therefore, What is this that he says, A little while? We don't know what he says. 
16:19 Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said to them, Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't see me, and again a little while, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will see me? 
16:20 Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be sorrowful, but your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sorrow will be turned into joy. 
16:21 A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour has come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world. 
16:22 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you<sup><small>+</small></sup> again, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart will rejoice, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> joy no one takes away from you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
16:23 And in that day you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will ask me no question. Truly, truly, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
16:24 Until now have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> asked nothing in my name: ask, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will receive, that your<sup><small>+</small></sup> joy may be made full.
16:25 These things I have spoken to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in dark sayings: the hour comes, when I will no more speak to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in dark sayings, but will tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup> plainly of the Father. 
16:26 In that day you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will ask in my name: and I don't say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that I will pray the Father for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; 
16:27 for the Father himself loves you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God. 
16:28 I came out from the Father, and have come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. 
16:29 His disciples say, Look, now you speak plainly, and speak no dark saying. 
16:30 Now we know that you know all things, and don't need that any man should ask you: by this we believe that you came forth from God. 
16:31 Jesus answered them, Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> now believe? 
16:32 Look, the hour comes, yes, has come, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be scattered, every man to his own, and will leave me alone: and [yet] I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 
16:33 These things I have spoken to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that in me you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may have peace. In the world you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
17:1 These things Jesus spoke; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son, that the Son may glorify you: 
17:2 even as you gave him authority over all flesh, that to all whom you have given him, he should give eternal life. 
17:3 And this is eternal life, that they should know you the only true God, and him whom you sent, [even] Jesus Christ. 
17:4 I glorified you on the earth, having accomplished the work which you have given me to do. 
17:5 And now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.
17:6 I manifested your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world: they were yours, and you gave them to me; and they have kept your word. 
17:7 Now they know that all things that you have given me are from you: 
17:8 for the words which you gave me I have given to them; and they received [them], and knew of a truth that I came forth from you, and they believed that you sent me. 
17:9 I pray for them: I don't pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me; for they are yours: 
17:10 and all things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine: and I am glorified in them. 
17:11 And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we [are]. 
17:12 While I was with them, I kept them in your name which you have given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled. 
17:13 But now I come to you; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves. 
17:14 I have given them your word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
17:15 I don't pray that you should take them from the world, but that you should keep them from the evil [one]. 
17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
17:17 Sanctify them in the truth: your word is truth. 
17:18 As you sent me into the world, even so I sent them into the world. 
17:19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
17:20 Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word; 
17:21 that they may all be one; even as you, Father, [are] in me, and I in you; that they also may be in us; that the world may believe that you sent me. 
17:22 And the glory which you have given me I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we [are] one; 
17:23 I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me. 
17:24 Father, [about] what you have given me, I desire that where I am those also may be with me, that they may see my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world. 
17:25 O righteous Father, the world didn't know you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me; 
17:26 and I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.
18:1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where a garden was, into which he entered, himself and his disciples. 
18:2 Now Judas also, who delivered him up, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted there with his disciples. 
18:3 Judas then, having received the battalion [of soldiers], and attendants from the chief priests and from the Pharisees, comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons. 
18:4 Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth, and says to them, Whom do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> seek? 
18:5 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. He says to them, I am [he]. And Judas also, who delivered him up, was standing with them. 
18:6 When therefore he said to them, I am [he], they went backward, and fell to the ground. 
18:7 Again therefore he asked them, Whom do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. 
18:8 Jesus answered, I told you<sup><small>+</small></sup> that I am [he]; if therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> seek me, let these go their way: 
18:9 that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, Of those whom you have given me I lost not one. 
18:10 Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. Now the slave's name was Malchus. 
18:11 Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?
18:12 So the battalion and the colonel, and the attendants of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him, 
18:13 and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 
18:14 Now Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
18:15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and [so did] another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; 
18:16 but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter. 
18:17 The female slave therefore who kept the door says to Peter, Are you also [one] of this man's disciples? He says, I am not. 
18:18 Now the slaves and the attendants were standing [there], having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.
18:19 The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching. 
18:20 Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret I spoke nothing. 
18:21 Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard [me], what I spoke to them: look, these know the things which I said. 
18:22 And when he had said this, one of the attendants standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Do you answer the high priest so? 
18:23 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why do you strike me? 
18:24 Annas therefore sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
18:25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, Are you also [one] of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not. 
18:26 One of the slaves of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Didn't I see you in the garden with him? 
18:27 Peter therefore denied again: and right away the rooster crowed.
18:28 They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover. 
18:29 Pilate therefore went out to them, and says, What accusation do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> bring against this man? 
18:30 They answered and said to him, If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up to you. 
18:31 Pilate therefore said to them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: 
18:32 that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what manner of death he should die. 
18:33 Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews? 
18:34 Jesus answered, Do you say this of yourself, or did others tell it to you concerning me? 
18:35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me: what have you done? 
18:36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then my attendants would fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from here. 
18:37 Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end I have been born, and to this end I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice. 
18:38 Pilate says to him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find no crime in him. 
18:39 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have a custom, that I should release to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> one at the Passover: do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> want therefore that I release to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the King of the Jews? 
18:40 They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. 
19:1 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. 
19:2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment; 
19:3 and they came to him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! And they struck him with their hands. 
19:4 And Pilate went out again, and says to them, Look, I bring him out to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may know that I find no crime in him. 
19:5 Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And [Pilate] says to them, Look, the man! 
19:6 When therefore the chief priests and the attendants saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify [him], crucify [him]! Pilate says to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him. 
19:7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
19:8 When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid; 
19:9 and he entered into the Praetorium again, and says to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer. 
19:10 Pilate therefore says to him, Don't you speak to me? Don't you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you? 
19:11 Jesus answered him, You would have no power against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin. 
19:12 On this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend: everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar. 
19:13 When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 
19:14 Now it was the Preparation of the Passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews, Look, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> King! 
19:15 They therefore cried out, Away with [him], away with [him], crucify him! Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your<sup><small>+</small></sup> King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. 
19:16 Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. They took Jesus therefore: 
19:17 and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha: 
19:18 where they crucified him, and with him two others, [one] on each side, and between them [was] Jesus. 
19:19 And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
19:20 This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, [and] in Latin, [and] in Greek. 
19:21 The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews; but, that he said, I am King of the Jews. 
19:22 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
19:23 The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. 
19:24 They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it will be: that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my garments among them, And on my vesture they cast lots. 
19:25 These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 
19:26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he says to his mother, Woman, here is your son. 
19:27 Then he says to the disciple, Here is your mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own [home].
19:28 After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the Scripture might be accomplished, says, I thirst. 
19:29 There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and brought it to his mouth. 
19:30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and delivered up his spirit.
19:31 The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not stay on the cross on the Sabbath (for the day of that Sabbath was a high [day]), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away. 
19:32 The soldiers therefore came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him: 
19:33 but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they did not break his legs: 
19:34 nevertheless one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately there came out blood and water.
19:35 And he who has seen has borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knows that he says true, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also may believe.
