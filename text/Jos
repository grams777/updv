1:1 Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the slave of Yahweh, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, 
1:2 Moses my slave is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, even to the sons of Israel. 
1:3 Every place that the sole of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> foot will tread on, to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> I have given it, as I spoke to Moses. 
1:4 From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, will be your<sup><small>+</small></sup> border. 
1:5 There will not be any man able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not fail you, nor forsake you. 
1:6 Be strong and of good courage; for you will cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. 
1:7 Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my slave commanded you: don't turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go. 
1:8 This book of the law will not depart out of your mouth, but you will meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it: for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. 
1:9 Haven't I commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; don't be frightened, neither be dismayed: for Yahweh your God is with you wherever you go.
1:10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 
1:11 Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare yourselves provisions; for within three days you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God gives you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to possess it.
1:12 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua spoke, saying, 
1:13 Remember the word which Moses the slave of Yahweh commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, saying, Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God gives you<sup><small>+</small></sup> rest, and will give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this land. 
1:14 Your<sup><small>+</small></sup> wives, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> little ones, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> cattle, will remain in the land which Moses gave you<sup><small>+</small></sup> beyond the Jordan; but you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will pass over before your<sup><small>+</small></sup> brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and will help them; 
1:15 until Yahweh gives your<sup><small>+</small></sup> brothers rest, as [he has given] you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and they also have possessed the land which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God gives them: then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will return to the land of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> possession, and possess it, which Moses the slave of Yahweh gave you<sup><small>+</small></sup> beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising. 
1:16 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 
1:17 According as we listened to Moses in all things, so we will listen to you: only Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses. 
1:18 Whoever he is that will rebel against your mouth, and will not listen to your words in all that you command him, he will be put to death: only be strong and of good courage.
2:1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and lay there. 
2:2 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Look, there came men in here tonight of the sons of Israel to search out the land. 
2:3 And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men who came to you, that entered into your house; for they came to search out all the land. 
2:4 And the woman took the two men. And she hid it, and she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I didn't know from where they were: 
2:5 and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; where the men went I don't know: pursue after them quickly; for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will overtake them. 
2:6 But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof. 
2:7 And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan to the fords: and as soon as those who pursued after them had gone out, they shut the gate.
2:8 And before they were laid down, she came up to them on the roof; 
2:9 and she said to the men, I know that Yahweh has given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the land, and that the fear of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> is fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
2:10 For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came out of Egypt; and what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> completely destroyed. 
2:11 And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain anymore spirit in any man, because of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: for Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath. 
2:12 Now therefore, I pray you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt kindly with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token; 
2:13 and that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all who they have, and will deliver our souls from death. 
2:14 And the men said to her, Our soul for yours<sup><small>+</small></sup>, if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not utter this business of ours; then it will be, when Yahweh gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.
2:15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was on the side of the wall, and she dwelt on the wall. 
2:16 And she said to them, Go<sup><small>+</small></sup> to the mountain, or else the pursuers will fall on you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; then hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers return: and afterward may you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go your<sup><small>+</small></sup> way. 
2:17 And the men said to her, We will be innocent of this oath of yours which you have made us to swear. 
2:18 Look, when we come into the land, you will bind this line of scarlet thread in the window by which you have let us down: and you will gather to yourself into the house your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father's household. 
2:19 And it will be, that whoever will go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be innocent: and whoever will be with you in the house, his blood will be on our head, if any hand is on him. 
2:20 But if you utter this business of ours, then we will be innocent of your oath which you have made us to swear. 
2:21 And she said, According to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
2:22 And then they went, and came to the mountain, and remained there three days, until the pursuers had returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but didn't find them. 
2:23 Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them. 
2:24 And they said to Joshua, Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us.
3:1 And Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over. 
3:2 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp; 
3:3 and they commanded the people, saying, When you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will remove from your<sup><small>+</small></sup> place, and go after it. 
3:4 Yet there will be a space between you<sup><small>+</small></sup> and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: don't come near to it, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may know the way by which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> must go; for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> haven't passed this way before. 
3:5 And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
3:6 And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
3:7 And Yahweh said to Joshua, This day I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. 
3:8 And you will command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you<sup><small>+</small></sup> come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will stand still in the Jordan. 
3:9 And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God. 
3:10 And Joshua said, Hereby you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will know that the living God is among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and that he will without fail drive out from before you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite. 
3:11 Look, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you<sup><small>+</small></sup> into the Jordan. 
3:12 Now therefore take for yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man. 
3:13 And it will come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth, will rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they will stand in one heap.
3:14 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people; 
3:15 and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest,) 
3:16 that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho. 
3:17 And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation had passed clean over the Jordan.
4:1 And it came to pass, when all the nation had clean passed over the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying, 
4:2 Take for yourselves twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe one man, 
4:3 and command<sup><small>+</small></sup> them, saying, Take for yourselves from here out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and lay them down in the lodging-place, where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will lodge this night. 
4:4 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the sons of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 
4:5 and Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God into the midst of the Jordan, and take<sup><small>+</small></sup> up every man of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel; 
4:6 that this may be a sign among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that, when your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons ask in time to come, saying, What do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> mean by these stones? 
4:7 Then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will say to them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off: and these stones will be for a memorial to the sons of Israel forever.
4:8 And the sons of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. 
4:9 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there to this day. 
4:10 For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hurried and passed over. 
4:11 And it came to pass, when all the people had clean passed over, that the ark of Yahweh and the priests moved up before the people. 
4:12 And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the sons of Israel, as Moses spoke to them: 
4:13 about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of Jericho. 
4:14 On that day Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
4:15 And Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying, 
4:16 Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan. 
4:17 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come<sup><small>+</small></sup> up out of the Jordan. 
4:18 And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh had come up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks, as previously.
4:19 And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho. 
4:20 And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal. 
4:21 And he spoke to the sons of Israel, saying, When your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons will ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What do these stones mean? 
4:22 Then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will let your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. 
4:23 For Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, until you<sup><small>+</small></sup> had passed over, as Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had passed over; 
4:24 that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh, that it is mighty; that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may fear Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God forever.
5:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the sons of Israel, until we had passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them anymore, because of the sons of Israel.
5:2 At that time Yahweh said to Joshua, Make for yourself knives of flint, and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time. 
5:3 And Joshua made for himself knives of flint, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. 
5:4 And this is the cause why Joshua circumcised: all the people who came forth out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt. 
5:5 For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised. 
5:6 For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men of war who came forth out of Egypt, was consumed, because they didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh: to whom Yahweh swore that he would not let them see the land which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
5:7 And their sons, whom he raised up in their stead, Joshua circumcised them: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way. 
5:8 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they remained in their places in the camp, until they were whole. 
5:9 And Yahweh said to Joshua, This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day.
5:10 And the sons of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho. 
5:11 And they ate of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the very same day. 
5:12 And the manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the sons of Israel manna anymore; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
5:13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that there stood a man across from him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries? 
5:14 And he said, No; but [as] prince of the host of Yahweh I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, What does my lord say to his slave? 
5:15 And the prince of Yahweh's host said to Joshua, Put off your sandal from off your foot; for the place on which you stand is holy. And Joshua did so.
6:1 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the sons of Israel: none went out, and none came in. 
6:2 And Yahweh said to Joshua, See, I have given into your hand Jericho and its king, mighty men of valor. 
6:3 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will circle the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus you will do six days. 
6:4 And seven priests will bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark: and the seventh day you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will circle the city seven times, and the priests will blow the trumpets. 
6:5 And it will be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people will shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people will go up every man straight before him. 
6:6 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh. 
6:7 And they said to the people, Pass on, and circle the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Yahweh.
6:8 And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before Yahweh passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them. 
6:9 And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went. 
6:10 And Joshua commanded the people, saying, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not shout, nor let your<sup><small>+</small></sup> voice be heard, neither will any word proceed out of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> mouth, until the day I bid you<sup><small>+</small></sup> shout; then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will shout. 
6:11 So he caused the ark of Yahweh to circle the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
6:12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh. 
6:13 And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of Yahweh, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went. 
6:14 And the second day they circled the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.
6:15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times. 
6:16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for Yahweh has given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the city. 
6:17 And the city will be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh: only Rahab the prostitute will live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. 
6:18 But as for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, or else you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will covet and take of the devoted thing; so you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it. 
6:19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are holy to Yahweh: they will come into the treasury of Yahweh. 
6:20 So the people shouted, and [the priests] blew the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. 
6:21 And they completely destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.
6:22 And Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there the woman, and all who she has, as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> swore to her. 
6:23 And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all who she had; all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them outside the camp of Israel. 
6:24 And they burned the city with fire, and all that was in it; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Yahweh. 
6:25 But Rahab the prostitute, and her father's household, and all who she had, Joshua saved alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 
6:26 And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Yahweh, that rises up and builds this city Jericho: with the loss of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son he will set up the gates of it. 
6:27 So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.
7:1 But the sons of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the sons of Israel.
7:2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai. 
7:3 And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Don't let all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai; don't make all the people to toil there; for they are but few. 
7:4 So there went up there of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai. 
7:5 And the men of Ai struck of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them [from] before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent: and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
7:6 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads. 
7:7 And Joshua said, Alas, O Sovereign Yahweh, why have you at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? Would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan! 
7:8 Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies! 
7:9 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth: and what will you do for your great name?
7:10 And Yahweh said to Joshua, Get yourself up; why are you thus fallen on your face? 
7:11 Israel has sinned; yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yes, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff. 
7:12 Therefore the sons of Israel can't stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become accursed: I will not be with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> anymore, except you<sup><small>+</small></sup> destroy the devoted thing from among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
7:13 Get up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for this is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, There is a devoted thing in the midst of you, O Israel; you can not stand before your enemies, until you<sup><small>+</small></sup> take away the devoted thing from among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
7:14 In the morning therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be brought near by your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tribes: and it will be, that the tribe which Yahweh takes will come near by families; and the family which Yahweh will take will come near by households; and the household which Yahweh will take will come near man by man. 
7:15 And it will be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing will be burned with fire, he and all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has wrought folly in Israel.
7:16 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: 
7:17 and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: 
7:18 and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. 
7:19 And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; don't hide it from me. 
7:20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and thus and thus I have done: 
7:21 when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonian mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, look, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
7:22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and, look, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it. 
7:23 And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the sons of Israel; and they laid them down before Yahweh. 
7:24 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up to the valley of Achor. 
7:25 And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and heaped stones upon them. 
7:26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones, to this day; and Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, to this day.
8:1 And Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed: take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land; 
8:2 And you will do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king: only its spoil, and its cattle, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will take for a prey to yourselves: set yourself an ambush for the city behind it.
8:3 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night. 
8:4 And he commanded them, saying, Look, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; don't go very far from the city, but all of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> be ready: 
8:5 and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city. And it will come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them; 
8:6 and they will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: so we will flee before them; 
8:7 and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God will deliver it into your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand. 
8:8 And it will be, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have seized on the city, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will set the city on fire; according to the word of Yahweh you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will do: see, I have commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
8:9 And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the ambush, and remained between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
8:10 And Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. 
8:11 And all the people, [even] the [men of] war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between him and Ai. 
8:12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city. 
8:13 So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their ambushers who were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley. 
8:14 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, for the encounter toward the Arabah; but he didn't know that there was an ambush against him behind the city. 
8:15 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 
8:16 And all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. 
8:17 And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, who didn't go out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
8:18 And Yahweh said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city. 
8:19 And [those in] the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hurried and set the city on fire. 
8:20 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, look, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people who fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers. 
8:21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai. 
8:22 And the others came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. 
8:23 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
8:24 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword. 
8:25 And all who fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai. 
8:26 For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had completely destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
8:27 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of Yahweh which he commanded Joshua. 
8:28 So Joshua burned Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day. 
8:29 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised on it a great heap of stones, to this day.
8:30 Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal, 
8:31 as Moses the slave of Yahweh commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered on it burnt-offerings to Yahweh, and sacrificed peace-offerings. 
8:32 And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the sons of Israel. 
8:33 And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, as well the sojourner as the homeborn; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the slave of Yahweh had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel. 
8:34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law. 
8:35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who were among them.
9:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard of it; 
9:2 that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
9:3 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai, 
9:4 they also worked craftily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins, old and rent and bound up, 
9:5 and old and patched sandals on their feet, and old garments on them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and had become moldy. 
9:6 And they went to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, We have come from a far country: now therefore make<sup><small>+</small></sup> a covenant with us. 
9:7 And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Perhaps you<sup><small>+</small></sup> dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? 
9:8 And they said to Joshua, We are your slaves. And Joshua said to them, Who are you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? And from where do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> come? 
9:9 And they said to him, From a very far country your slaves have come because of the name of Yahweh your God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt, 
9:10 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. 
9:11 And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provision in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your<sup><small>+</small></sup> slaves: and now make<sup><small>+</small></sup> a covenant with us. 
9:12 This bread of ours we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; but now, look, it is dry, and has become moldy: 
9:13 and these wineskins, which we filled, were new; and, look, they are rent: and these garments of ours and our sandals have become old by reason of the very long journey. 
9:14 And the men took of their provision, and didn't ask counsel at the mouth of Yahweh. 
9:15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation swore to them.
9:16 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they lived nearby, and that they dwelt among them; 
9:17 for the sons of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. 
9:18 And the sons of Israel did not strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes. 
9:19 But all the princes said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them. 
9:20 This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them. 
9:21 And the princes said to them, Let them live and become cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation. So they became cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them.
9:22 And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> dwell among us? 
9:23 Now therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are cursed, and there will never fail to be of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> slaves, both cutters of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God. 
9:24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told your slaves, how that Yahweh your God commanded his slave Moses to give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; therefore we were very afraid for our souls because of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and have done this thing. 
9:25 And now, look, we are in your hand: as it seems good and right to you to do to us, do. 
9:26 And so he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the sons of Israel, that they did not slay them. 
9:27 And Joshua made them that day cutters of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place which he should choose.
10:1 Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had completely destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them; 
10:2 that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty. 
10:3 Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, 
10:4 Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel. 
10:5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.
10:6 And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, Do not slack your hand from your slaves; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us. 
10:7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. 
10:8 And Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't fear them: for I have delivered them into your hands; not a man of them will stand before you. 
10:9 Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; [for] he went up from Gilgal all the night. 
10:10 And Yahweh discomfited them before Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and struck them to Azekah, and to Makkedah. 
10:11 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Yahweh cast down great stones from heaven on them to Azekah, and they died: they who died with the hailstones were more than they whom the sons of Israel slew with the sword.
10:12 Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand still on Gibeon; And, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon. 
10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Isn't this written in the Book of Jashar? And the sun stopped in the midst of heaven, and didn't hurry to go down about a whole day. 
10:14 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man: for Yahweh fought for Israel.
10:15 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
10:16 And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. 
10:17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah. 
10:18 And Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them: 
10:19 but don't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> stop; pursue after your<sup><small>+</small></sup> enemies, and strike the hindmost of them; don't allow them to enter into their cities: for Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God has delivered them into your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand. 
10:20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the sons of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities, 
10:21 that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the sons of Israel.
10:22 Then Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings to me out of the cave. 
10:23 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon. 
10:24 And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your<sup><small>+</small></sup> feet on the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet on the necks of them. 
10:25 And Joshua said to them, Don't be afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus will Yahweh do to all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> enemies against whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> fight. 
10:26 And afterward Joshua struck them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging on the trees until the evening. 
10:27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, to this very day.
10:28 And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king: he completely destroyed them and all the souls who were in it; he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
10:29 And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah: 
10:30 and Yahweh delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel; and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were in it; he left none remaining in it; and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
10:31 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: 
10:32 and Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
10:33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
10:34 And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it; 
10:35 and they took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls who were in it he completely destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
10:36 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it: 
10:37 and they took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and all the souls who were in it; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he completely destroyed it, and all the souls who were in it.
10:38 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it: 
10:39 and he took it, and its king, and all its cities; and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and completely destroyed all the souls who were in it; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.
10:40 So Joshua struck all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but he completely destroyed all that breathed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded. 
10:41 And Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon. 
10:42 And all these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel. 
10:43 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
11:1 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent to Jobab king of Maron, and to the king of Shimeon, and to the king of Achshaph, 
11:2 and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west, 
11:3 to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah. 
11:4 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, many people, even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many. 
11:5 And all these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
11:6 And Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid because of them; for tomorrow at this time I will deliver them up all slain before Israel: you will hock their horses, and burn their chariots with fire. 
11:7 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell on them. 
11:8 And Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them, and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they struck them, until they left them none remaining. 
11:9 And Joshua did to them as Yahweh bade him: he hocked their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.
11:10 And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword: for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms. 
11:11 And they struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, completely destroying them; there was none left that breathed: and he burned Hazor with fire. 
11:12 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, Joshua took, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and completely destroyed them; as Moses the slave of Yahweh commanded. 
11:13 But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only; that Joshua burned. 
11:14 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the sons of Israel took for a prey to themselves; but all of man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither had they left any that breathed. 
11:15 As Yahweh commanded Moses his slave, so did Moses command Joshua: and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that Yahweh commanded Moses.
11:16 So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the lowland of the same; 
11:17 from mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and struck them, and put them to death. 
11:18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. 
11:19 There was not a city that made peace with the sons of Israel, except the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: they took all in battle. 
11:20 For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might completely destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
11:21 And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel: Joshua completely destroyed them with their cities. 
11:22 There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the sons of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain. 
11:23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.
12:1 Now these are the kings of the land, whom the sons of Israel struck, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising, from the valley of the Arnon to mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward: 
12:2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and [the city that is in] the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon; 
12:3 and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and to the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah 
12:4 and its border. Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 
12:5 and ruled in mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and [as far as] half of Gilead which is the territory of Sihon king of Heshbon. 
12:6 Moses the slave of Yahweh and the sons of Israel struck them: and Moses the slave of Yahweh gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
12:7 And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even to mount Halak, that goes up to Seir; and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions; 
12:8 in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
12:9 the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one; 
12:10 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 
12:11 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 
12:12 the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 
12:13 the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 
12:14 the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 
12:15 the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 
12:16 the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 
12:17 the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 
12:18 the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one; 
12:19 the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; 
12:20 the king of Shimeon-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; 
12:21 the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 
12:22 the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one; 
12:23 the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Galilee, one; 
12:24 the king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.
13:1 Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Yahweh said to him, You are old and well stricken in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed. 
13:2 This is the land that yet remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites; 
13:3 from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border of Ekron northward, [which] is reckoned to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim, 
13:4 on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and from Arah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the border of the Amorites; 
13:5 and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath; 
13:6 all the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians; I will drive them out from before the sons of Israel: only allot it to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you. 
13:7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh; from the Jordan as far as the great sea in the west, you will give it--the great sea and its border.
13:8 To the two tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh, with it the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the slave of Yahweh gave them: 
13:9 from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon; 
13:10 and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the sons of Ammon; 
13:11 and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah; 
13:12 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for these Moses struck, and drove them out. 
13:13 Nevertheless the sons of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day. 
13:14 Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance, as he spoke to him.
13:15 And Moses gave to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families. 
13:16 And their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba; 
13:17 Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon, 
13:18 and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, 
13:19 and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar in the mount of the valley, 
13:20 and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth, 
13:21 and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who dwelt in the land. 
13:22 Balaam also the son of Beor, the fortune-teller, the sons of Israel slew with the sword among the rest of their slain. 
13:23 And the border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border [of it]. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, the cities and its villages.
13:24 And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad, according to their families. 
13:25 And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah; 
13:26 and from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Lidebor; 
13:27 and in the valley, Beth-haram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan and the border [of it], to the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward. 
13:28 This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, the cities and its villages.
13:29 And Moses gave [inheritance] to the half-tribe of Manasseh: and it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families. 
13:30 And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities: 
13:31 and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the sons of Machir according to their families.
13:32 These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward. 
13:33 But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: Yahweh, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spoke to them.
14:1 And these are the inheritances which the sons of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes of the sons of Israel, distributed to them, 
14:2 by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe. 
14:3 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan: but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. 
14:4 For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with its suburbs for their cattle and for their substance. 
14:5 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did; and they divided the land.
14:6 Then the sons of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh-barnea. 
14:7 I was forty years old when Moses the slave of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought back word to him as it was in my heart. 
14:8 Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God. 
14:9 And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land on which your foot has trodden will be an inheritance to you and to your sons forever, because you have wholly followed Yahweh my God. 
14:10 And now, look, Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke, these forty and five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, look, I am this day 85 years old. 
14:11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in. 
14:12 Now therefore give me this hill-country, of which Yahweh spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified: it may be that Yahweh will be with me, and I will drive them out, as Yahweh spoke.
14:13 And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. 
14:14 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because he wholly followed Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
14:15 Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba, which was great among man of Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
15:1 And the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin to the Negeb, at the uttermost part of the south. 
15:2 And their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looks southward; 
15:3 and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned about to Karka; 
15:4 and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea: this will be your<sup><small>+</small></sup> south border. 
15:5 And the east border was the Salt Sea, even to the end of the Jordan. And the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan; 
15:6 and the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben; 
15:7 and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is across from the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river; and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out of it were at En-rogel; 
15:8 and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of the valley of Rephaim northward; 
15:9 and the border extended from the top of the mountain to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to Iyyim of mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (the same is Kiriath-jearim); 
15:10 and the border turned about from Baalah westward to mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim on the north (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah; 
15:11 and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea. 
15:12 And the west border was to the great sea, and the border [of it]. This is the border of the sons of Judah round about according to their families.
15:13 And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the sons of Judah, according to the mouth of Yahweh to Joshua, even Kiriath-arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak (the same is Hebron). 
15:14 And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. 
15:15 And he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher. 
15:16 And Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath-sepher, and takes it, to him I will give Achsah my daughter as wife. 
15:17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife. 
15:18 And it came to pass, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she dismounted from off her donkey; and Caleb said, What do you want? 
15:19 And she said, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
15:20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families. 
15:21 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the sons of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur, 
15:22 and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Aradah, 
15:23 and Kedesh, and Hazor of Ithnan,

15:47 Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; to the brook of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border [of it].
15:48 And in the hill-country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,

15:62 and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages.
15:63 And as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the sons of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the sons of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
16:1 And the lot came out for the sons of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east, even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill-country to Beth-el; 
16:2 and it went out from Beth-el to Luz, and passed along to the border of the Archites to Ataroth; 
16:3 and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, to the border of Beth-horon the nether, even to Gezer; and the goings out of it were at the sea. 
16:4 And the sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
16:5 And the border of the sons of Ephraim according to their families was [thus]: the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, to Beth-horon the upper; 
16:6 and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north; and the border turned about eastward to Taanath-shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah; 
16:7 and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah, and reached to Jericho, and went out at the Jordan. 
16:8 From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out of it were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim according to their families; 
16:9 together with the cities which were set apart for the sons of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. 
16:10 And they did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day, and have become slave labor.
17:1 And [this] was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. 
17:2 So [the lot] was for the rest of the sons of Manasseh according to their families: for the sons of Abiezer, and for the sons of Helek, and for the sons of Asriel, and for the sons of Shechem, and for the sons of Hepher, and for the sons of Shemida: these were the male sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families. 
17:3 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
17:4 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers: therefore according to the mouth of Yahweh he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father. 
17:5 And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan; 
17:6 because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
17:7 And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand, to Jashib-en-tappuah. 
17:8 The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim. 
17:9 And the border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook: these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and the goings out of it were at the sea: 
17:10 southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east. 
17:11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, the third height. 
17:12 Yet the sons of Manasseh could not drive out [the inhabitants of] those cities; but the Canaanites determined to dwell in that land. 
17:13 And it came to pass, when the sons of Israel were waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to slave labor, and did not completely drive them out.
17:14 And the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, since until now Yahweh has blessed me? 
17:15 And Joshua said to them, If you are a great people, go up for yourself to the forest, and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for you. 
17:16 And the sons of Joseph said, The hill-country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel. 
17:17 And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have great power; you will not have one lot only: 
17:18 but the hill-country will be yours; for though it is a forest, you will cut it down, and the goings out of it will be yours; for you will drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.
18:1 And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and caused the tent of meeting to stay there: and the land was subdued before them. 
18:2 And there remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet divided their inheritance. 
18:3 And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, How long are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> slack to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh, the God of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers, has given you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? 
18:4 Appoint for yourselves three men of each tribe: and I will send them, and they will arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they will come to me. 
18:5 And they will divide it into seven portions: Judah will remain in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph will remain in their border on the north. 
18:6 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will describe the land into seven portions, and bring [the description] here to me; and I will cast lots for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> here before Yahweh our God. 
18:7 For the Levites have no portion among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance: and Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the slave of Yahweh gave them.
18:8 And the men arose, and went: and Joshua charged those who went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> here before Yahweh in Shiloh. 
18:9 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book; and they came to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh. 
18:10 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh: and there Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions.
18:11 And the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border of their lot went out between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph. 
18:12 And their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill-country westward; and the goings out of it were at the wilderness of Beth-aven. 
18:13 And the border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Beth-el), southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-orech, by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth-horon the nether. 
18:14 And the border extended [from there], and turned about on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out of it were at Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah: this was the west quarter. 
18:15 And the south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim; and the border went out toward Iyyim, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah; 
18:16 and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel; 
18:17 and it extended northward, and went out at En-shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is across from the ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben; 
18:18 and it passed along to the side across from the Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah; 
18:19 and the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the goings out of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this was the south border. 
18:20 And the Jordan was the border of it on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, by its borders round about, according to their families.
18:21 Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz, 
18:22 and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el, 
18:23 and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah, 
18:24 and Chephar-ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages: 
18:25 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth, 
18:26 and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah, 
18:27 and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah, 
18:28 and Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, that is Jerusalem, Gibeath, [and] Kiriath-jearim; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families.
19:1 And the second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Judah. 
19:2 And they had for their inheritance Beer-sheba, and Shema, and Moladah, 
19:3 and Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Ezem, 
19:4 and Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah, 
19:5 and Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah, 
19:6 and Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages: 
19:7 En-rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan: 
19:8 and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalath-beer, Ramah of the South. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families. 
19:9 Out of the part of the sons of Judah was the inheritance of the sons of Simeon; for the portion of the sons of Judah was too much for them: therefore the sons of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
19:10 And the third lot came up for the sons of Zebulun according to their families; and the border of their inheritance was to Sarid; 
19:11 and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam; 
19:12 and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising to the border of Chisloth-tabor; and it went out to Daberath, and went up to Japhia; 
19:13 and from there it passed along eastward to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin; and it went out at Rimmonah stretching to Neah; 
19:14 and the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon; and the goings out of it were at the valley of Iphtah-el; 
19:15 and Kattath, and Nahalal, and Shimeon, and Jiralah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages. 
19:16 This is the inheritance of the sons of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
19:17 The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the sons of Issachar according to their families. 
19:18 And their border was to Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,

19:20 and Rabbith, and Kishion, and Ebez, 
19:21 and Remeth, and Engannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez, 
19:22 and the border reached to Tabor, and Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh; and the goings out of their border were at the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages. 
19:23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar according to their families, the cities with their villages.
19:24 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families. 
19:25 And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph, 
19:26 and Allammelech, and Amad, and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath; 
19:27 and it turned toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah-el northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left hand, 
19:28 and Adbon, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Sidon; 
19:29 and the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah, and the goings out of it were at the sea; Mahalab, Achzib; 
19:30 Acco also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages. 
19:31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
19:32 The sixth lot came out for the sons of Naphtali, even for the sons of Naphtali according to their families. 
19:33 And their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakkum; and the goings out of it were at the Jordan; 
19:34 and the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from there to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Jehuda at the Jordan toward the sunrising. 
19:35 And the fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth, 
19:36 and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor, 
19:37 and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor, 
19:38 And Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages. 
19:39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with their villages.
19:40 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families. 
19:41 And the border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh, 
19:42 and Shaalabbin, and Aijalon, and Ithlah,

19:46 and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border across from Joppa. 
19:47 And the border of the sons of Dan went out beyond them; for the sons of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt in it, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father. 
19:48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
19:49 So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by its borders; and the sons of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them: 
19:50 according to the mouth of Yahweh they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the hill-country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt in it.
19:51 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes of the sons of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the tent of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land.
20:1 And Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying, 
20:2 Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Assign for yourselves the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> by Moses, 
20:3 that the manslayer who strikes any soul unintentionally [and] unawares may flee there: and they will be to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> for a refuge from the avenger of blood. 
20:4 And he will flee to one of those cities, and will stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they will take him into the city to them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. 
20:5 And if the avenger of blood pursues after him, then they will not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he struck his fellow man unawares, and did not hate him formerly. 
20:6 And he will dwell in that city, until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest who will be in those days: then the manslayer will return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city from where he fled.
20:7 And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill-country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill-country of Judah. 
20:8 And beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. 
20:9 These were the appointed cities for all the sons of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them, that whoever strikes any soul unintentionally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stands before the congregation.
21:1 Then the heads of fathers' [houses] of the Levites came near to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of fathers' [houses] of the tribes of the sons of Israel; 
21:2 and they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, Yahweh commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for our cattle. 
21:3 And the sons of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the mouth of Yahweh, these cities with their suburbs.
21:4 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
21:5 And the rest of the sons of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
21:6 And the sons of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
21:7 The sons of Merari according to their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
21:8 And the sons of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as Yahweh commanded by Moses. 
21:9 And they gave out of the tribe of the sons of Judah, and out of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, these cities which are [here] mentioned by name: 
21:10 and they were for the sons of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the sons of Levi; for theirs was the first lot. 
21:11 And they gave them Kiriath-arba, [Arba was] the father of Anak (the same is Hebron), in the hill-country of Judah, with its suburbs round about it. 
21:12 But the fields of the city, and its villages, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
21:13 And to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs--the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with its suburbs, 
21:14 and Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs, 
21:15 and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs, 
21:16 and Ashan with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs, [and] Beth-shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes. 
21:17 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs, 
21:18 Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities. 
21:19 All the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
21:20 And the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the sons of Kohath, they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim. 
21:21 And they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill-country of Ephraim--the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer with its suburbs, 
21:22 and Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth-horon with its suburbs; four cities. 
21:23 And out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs, 
21:24 Aijalon with its suburbs, and Jibleam with its suburbs; four cities. 
21:25 And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; two cities. 
21:26 All the cities of the families of the rest of the sons of Kohath were ten with their suburbs.
21:27 And to the sons of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh [they gave] Golan in Bashan with its suburbs--the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Be-eshterah with its suburbs; two cities. 
21:28 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its suburbs, Daberath with its suburbs, 
21:29 Jarmuth with its suburbs, En-gannim with its suburbs; four cities. 
21:30 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs, 
21:31 Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities. 
21:32 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs--the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammoth-dor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities. 
21:33 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
21:34 And to the families of the sons of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs, and Kartah with its suburbs, 
21:35 Rimmonah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities. 
21:36 And from beyond the Jordan at Jericho, out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer in the desert of the plateau with its suburbs--the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Jazer with its suburbs, 
21:37 Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs; four cities. 
21:38 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs--the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with its suburbs, 
21:39 Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all. 
21:40 All [these were] the cities of the sons of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.
21:41 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs. 
21:42 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus it was with all these cities.
21:43 So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt in it. 
21:44 And Yahweh gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore to their fathers: and there didn't stand a man of all their enemies before them; Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their hand. 
21:45 There did not fail anything of any good thing which Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.
22:1 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 
22:2 and said to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have kept all that Moses the slave of Yahweh commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: 
22:3 you<sup><small>+</small></sup> haven't left your<sup><small>+</small></sup> brothers these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God. 
22:4 And now Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God has given rest to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> brothers, as he spoke to them: therefore now turn<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tents, to the land of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> possession, which Moses the slave of Yahweh gave you<sup><small>+</small></sup> beyond the Jordan. 
22:5 Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the slave of Yahweh commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, to love Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to stick to him, and to serve him with all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart and with all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> soul. 
22:6 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went to their tents.
22:7 Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given [inheritance] in Bashan; but to the other half Joshua gave among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them, 
22:8 and spoke to them, saying, Return with much wealth to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with bronze, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> enemies with your<sup><small>+</small></sup> brothers. 
22:9 And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the sons of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, of which they acquired possession, according to the mouth of Yahweh by Moses.
22:10 And when they came to the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, a great altar to look at. 
22:11 And the sons of Israel heard it said, Look, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertains to the sons of Israel. 
22:12 And when the sons of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the sons of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.
22:13 And the sons of Israel sent to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, 
22:14 and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of them head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel. 
22:15 And they came to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying, 
22:16 Thus says the whole congregation of Yahweh, What trespass is this that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Yahweh, in that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have built yourselves an altar, to rebel this day against Yahweh? 
22:17 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we haven't cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came a plague on the congregation of Yahweh, 
22:18 that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> must turn away this day from following Yahweh? And it will be, seeing you<sup><small>+</small></sup> rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel. 
22:19 Nevertheless, if the land of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> possession is unclean, then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> pass over to the land of the possession of Yahweh, in which Yahweh's tabernacle stays, and take possession among us: but don't rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us, in building yourselves an altar besides the altar of Yahweh our God. 
22:20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? And that man didn't perish alone in his iniquity.
22:21 Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel, 
22:22 The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows; and Israel he will know: if it is in rebellion, or if in trespass against Yahweh, don't you save us this day. 
22:23 If we have built ourselves an altar to turn away from following Yahweh; or if to offer on it burnt-offering or meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings on it, let Yahweh himself require it. 
22:24 And if we have not [rather] out of carefulness done this, [and] of purpose, saying, In time to come your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons might speak to our sons, saying, What do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel? 
22:25 For Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons of Reuben and sons of Gad; you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have no portion in Yahweh: so might your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons make our sons cease from fearing Yahweh. 
22:26 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice: 
22:27 but it will be a witness between us and you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Yahweh before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons may not say to our sons in time to come, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have no portion in Yahweh. 
22:28 Therefore we said, It will be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we will say, Look at the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
22:29 Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh, and turn away this day from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle.
22:30 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well. 
22:31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Manasseh, This day we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us, because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> haven't committed this trespass against Yahweh: now you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have delivered the sons of Israel out of the hand of Yahweh. 
22:32 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the sons of Reuben, and from the sons of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought word back to them. 
22:33 And the thing pleased the sons of Israel; and the sons of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad dwelt. 
22:34 And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad gave the altar a name: It is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.
23:1 And it came to pass after many days, when Yahweh had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well stricken in years; 
23:2 that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said to them, I am old and well stricken in years: 
23:3 and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have seen all that Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God has done to all these nations because of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; for Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, it is he who has fought for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
23:4 Look, I have allotted to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea toward the going down of the sun. 
23:5 And Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, he will thrust them out from before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and drive them from out of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sight; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will possess their land, as Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God spoke to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
23:6 Therefore be<sup><small>+</small></sup> very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't turn aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left; 
23:7 that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't come among these nations, these that remain among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear [by them], neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves to them; 
23:8 but stick to Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have done to this day. 
23:9 For Yahweh has driven out from before you<sup><small>+</small></sup> great and strong nations: but as for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, no man has stood before you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to this day. 
23:10 One man of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will chase a thousand; for Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, it is he who fights for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, as he spoke to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
23:11 Take good heed therefore to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> souls, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> love Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God. 
23:12 Else if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do at all go back, and stick to the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and make marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; 
23:13 know for a certainty that Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God will no more drive these nations from out of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sight; but they will be a snare and a trap to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and a scourge in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sides, and thorns in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> eyes, until you<sup><small>+</small></sup> perish from off this good land which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God has given you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
23:14 And, look, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know in all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts and in all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> souls, that not one thing has failed of all the good things which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God spoke concerning you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; all have come to pass to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, not one thing has failed of them. 
23:15 And it will come to pass, that as all the good things have come upon you<sup><small>+</small></sup> of which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God spoke to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, so will Yahweh bring on you<sup><small>+</small></sup> all the evil things, until he destroys you<sup><small>+</small></sup> from off this good land which Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God has given you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
23:16 When you<sup><small>+</small></sup> transgress the covenant of Yahweh your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God, which he commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and go and serve other gods, and bow down yourselves to them; then the anger of Yahweh will be kindled against you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will perish quickly from off the good land which he has given to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
24:1 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God. 
24:2 And Joshua said to all the people, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods. 
24:3 And I took your<sup><small>+</small></sup> father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. 
24:4 And I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir, to possess it: and Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt. 
24:5 And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst of it: and afterward I brought you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out. 
24:6 And I brought your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers out of Egypt: and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the Red Sea. 
24:7 And when they cried out to Yahweh, he put darkness between you<sup><small>+</small></sup> and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them, and covered them; and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> dwelt in the wilderness many days. 
24:8 And I brought you<sup><small>+</small></sup> into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; and I gave them into your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
24:9 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel: and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; 
24:10 but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you<sup><small>+</small></sup> still: so I delivered you<sup><small>+</small></sup> out of his hand. 
24:11 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand. 
24:12 And I sent the hornet before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, which drove them out from before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword, nor with your bow. 
24:13 And I gave you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not build, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> dwell in them; of vineyards and oliveyards which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not plant, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are eating.
24:14 Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve<sup><small>+</small></sup> Yahweh. 
24:15 And if it seems evil to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to serve Yahweh, choose you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this day whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will serve; whether the gods which your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers served who were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you<sup><small>+</small></sup> dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh.
24:16 And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh, to serve other gods; 
24:17 for Yahweh our God, it is he who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slaves, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed; 
24:18 and Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land: therefore we also will serve Yahweh; for he is our God.
24:19 And Joshua said to the people, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> can't serve Yahweh; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your<sup><small>+</small></sup> transgression nor your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sins. 
24:20 If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do evil to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and consume you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, after he has done you<sup><small>+</small></sup> good. 
24:21 And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve Yahweh. 
24:22 And Joshua said to the people, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are witnesses against yourselves that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have chosen for yourselves Yahweh, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses. 
24:23 Now therefore put away, [he said], the foreign gods which are among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and incline your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
24:24 And the people said to Joshua, Yahweh our God we will serve, and to his voice we will listen. 
24:25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. 
24:26 And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh. 
24:27 And Joshua said to all the people, Look, this stone will be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of Yahweh which he spoke to us: it will therefore be a witness against you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, in case you<sup><small>+</small></sup> deny your<sup><small>+</small></sup> God. 
24:28 So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
24:29 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the slave of Yahweh, died, being a hundred and ten years old. 
24:30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. 
24:31 And Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of Yahweh, that he had wrought for Israel.
24:32 And the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred kesitah [of silver]: and they became the inheritance of the sons of Joseph. 
24:33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given to him in the hill-country of Ephraim.
