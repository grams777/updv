1:1 []
2:1 []
3:1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, 
3:2 in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. 
3:3 And he came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance to remission of sins; 
3:4 as it is written in the Book of the Words of Isaiah the Prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make<sup><small>+</small></sup> ready the way of Yahweh, Make his paths straight. 
3:5 Every valley will be filled, And every mountain and hill will be brought low; And the crooked will become straight, And the rough ways smooth; 
3:6 And all flesh will see the salvation of God.
3:7 He said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> offspring of vipers, who warned you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to flee from the wrath to come? 
3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and don't begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father: for I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. 
3:9 And even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.
3:10 And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we do? 
3:11 And he answered and said to them, He who has two coats, let him impart to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise. 
3:12 And there came also publicans to be baptized, and they said to him, Teacher, what must we do? 
3:13 And he said to them, Collect no more than that which is appointed you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
3:14 And soldiers also asked him, saying, And we, what must we do? And he said to them, Extort from no man by violence, neither accuse [anyone] wrongfully; and be content with your<sup><small>+</small></sup> wages.
3:15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he might be the Christ; 
3:16 John answered, saying to them all, I indeed baptize you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in water; but there comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to unloose: he will baptize you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the Holy Spirit and [in] fire: 
3:17 whose fan is in his hand, thoroughly to cleanse his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire. 
3:18 With many other exhortations therefore he preached good news to the people; 
3:19 but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother's wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done, 
3:20 added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
3:21 Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that, Jesus also having been baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, 
3:22 and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form, as a dove, on him, and a voice came out of heaven, You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.
3:23 And Jesus was about thirty years of age. He was known as: the son of Joseph, the [son] of Eli,
3:24 the [son] of Matthat, the [son] of Levi, the [son] of Melchi, the [son] of Jannai, the [son] of Joseph,
3:25 the [son] of Mattathias, the [son] of Amos, the [son] of Nahum, the [son] of Esli, the [son] of Naggai,
3:26 the [son] of Maath, the [son] of Mattathias, the [son] of Semein, the [son] of Josech, the [son] of Joda,
3:27 the [son] of Joanan, the [son] of Rhesa, the [son] of Zerubbabel, the [son] of Shealtiel, the [son] of Neri,
3:28 the [son] of Melchi, the [son] of Addi, the [son] of Cosam, the [son] of Elmadam, the [son] of Er,
3:29 the [son] of Jesus, the [son] of Eliezer, the [son] of Jorim, the [son] of Matthat, the [son] of Levi,
3:30 the [son] of Symeon, the [son] of Judas, the [son] of Joseph, the [son] of Jonam, the [son] of Eliakim,
3:31 the [son] of Melea, the [son] of Menna, the [son] of Mattatha, the [son] of Nathan, the [son] of David,
3:32 the [son] of Jesse, the [son] of Obed, the [son] of Boaz, the [son] of Sala, the [son] of Nahshon,
3:33 the [son] of Amminadab, the [son] of Admin, the [son] of Arni, the [son] of Hezron, the [son] of Perez, the [son] of Judah,
3:34 the [son] of Jacob, the [son] of Isaac, the [son] of Abraham, the [son] of Terah, the [son] of Nahor,
3:35 the [son] of Serug, the [son] of Reu, the [son] of Peleg, the [son] of Eber, the [son] of Shelah,
3:36 the [son] of Cainan, the [son] of Arphaxad, the [son] of Shem, the [son] of Noah, the [son] of Lamech,
3:37 the [son] of Methuselah, the [son] of Enoch, the [son] of Jared, the [son] of Mahalaleel, the [son] of Cainan,
3:38 the [son] of Enos, the [son] of Seth, the [son] of Adam, the [son] of God.
4:1 And Jesus returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spirit in the wilderness 
4:2 during forty days, being tried by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days: and when they were completed, he was hungry. 
4:3 And the devil said to him, If you are the Son of God, command this stone that it become bread. 
4:4 And Jesus answered to him, It is written, Man will not live by bread alone. 
4:5 And he led him up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
4:6 And the devil said to him, To you I will give all this authority, and the glory of them: for it has been delivered to me; and to whomever I will I give it. 
4:7 If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours. 
4:8 And Jesus answered and said to him, It is written, You will worship Yahweh your God, and you will serve only him. 
4:9 And he led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here: 
4:10 for it is written, He will give his angels charge concerning you, to guard you: 
4:11 and, On their hands they will bear you up, Lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone. 
4:12 And Jesus answering said to him, It is said, You will not make trial of Yahweh your God. 
4:13 And when the devil had completed every trial, he departed from him for a season.
4:14 And Jesus returned into Galilee: and news went out concerning him through all the surrounding region. 
4:15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
4:16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. 
4:17 And there was delivered to him the Book of the Prophet Isaiah. And he unrolled the book, and found the place where it was written, 
4:18 The Spirit of Yahweh is on me, Because he anointed me to preach good news to the poor: He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives, And recovering of sight to the blind, To set at liberty those who are bruised, 
4:19 To proclaim the acceptable year of Yahweh. 
4:20 And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. 
4:21 And he began to say to them, Today has this Scripture been fulfilled in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> ears. 
4:22 And all bore him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth: and they said, Isn't this Joseph's son? 
4:23 And he said to them, Doubtless you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will say to me this parable, Physician, heal yourself: whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your own country. 
4:24 And he said, Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, No prophet is acceptable in his own country. 
4:25 But of a truth I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land; 
4:26 and to none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. 
4:27 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian. 
4:28 And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things; 
4:29 and they rose up, and cast him forth out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong. 
4:30 But he passing through among them went his way.
4:31 And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath day: 
4:32 and they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority.
4:33 And in the synagogue there was a man, who had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice, 
4:34 Ah! What do we have to do with you, Jesus you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God. 
4:35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the middle [of the synagogue], he came out of him, having done him no hurt. 
4:36 And amazement came upon all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out. 
4:37 And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place around the region.
4:38 And he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon's wife's mother was held with a great fever; and they implored him for her. 
4:39 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and served them.
4:40 And when the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with diverse diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on each one of them, and healed them. 
4:41 And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, You are the Son of God. And rebuking them, he did not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. 
4:42 And when it was day, he came out and went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came to him, and tried to keep him, that he should not go from them. 
4:43 But he said to them, I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore I was sent. 
4:44 And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
5:1 Now it came to pass, while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret; 
5:2 and he saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets. 
5:3 And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat.
5:4 And when he had left speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your<sup><small>+</small></sup> nets for a catch. 
5:5 And Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at your word I will let down the nets. 
5:6 And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish; and their nets were breaking; 
5:7 and they beckoned to their sharers in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. 
5:8 But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. 
5:9 For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of the fish which they had taken; 
5:10 and so were also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Don't be afraid; from now on you will catch men. 
5:11 And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him.
5:12 And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, look, a man full of leprosy: and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and implored him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean. 
5:13 And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be made clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. 
5:14 And he charged him to tell no man: but go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing, according to as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. 
5:15 But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities. 
5:16 But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed.
5:17 And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of Yahweh was with him to heal.
5:18 And look, men bring on a bed a man who was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him. 
5:19 And not finding by what [way] they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the middle [of everyone] before Jesus. 
5:20 And seeing their faith, he said, Man, your sins are forgiven you. 
5:21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? 
5:22 But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and said to them, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> reason in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts? 
5:23 Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise and walk? 
5:24 But that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins--he said to him who was palsied: I say to you, Arise, and take up your couch, and go to your house. 
5:25 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that on which he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God. 
5:26 And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.
5:27 And after these things he went forth, and noticed a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said to him, Follow me. 
5:28 And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him. 
5:29 And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others who were sitting at meat with them. 
5:30 And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> eat and drink with the publicans and sinners? 
5:31 And Jesus answering said to them, Those who are in health have no need of a physician; but those who are sick. 
5:32 I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. 
5:33 And they said to him, The disciples of John fast often, and make supplications; likewise also the [disciples] of the Pharisees; but yours eat and drink. 
5:34 And Jesus said to them, Can you<sup><small>+</small></sup> make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? 
5:35 But the days will come; and when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, then they will fast in those days. 
5:36 And he spoke also a parable to them: No man rends a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old. 
5:37 And no man puts new wine into old wineskins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, and the skins will perish. 
5:38 But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. 
5:39 And no man having drank old [wine] desires new; for he says, The old is good.
6:1 Now it came to pass on a Sabbath, that he was going through the grainfields; and his disciples plucked and ate the ears, rubbing them in their hands. 
6:2 But certain of the Pharisees said, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day? 
6:3 And Jesus answering them said, Have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not read even this, what David did, when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him; 
6:4 how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the showbread, and gave to those who were with him; which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone? 
6:5 And he said to them, The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
6:6 And it came to pass on another Sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered. 
6:7 And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the Sabbath; that they might find how to accuse him. 
6:8 But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand in the middle [of the synagogue]. And he arose and stood. 
6:9 And Jesus said to them, I ask you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a soul, or to destroy it? 
6:10 And he looked around on them all, and said to him, Stretch forth your hand. And he did [so]: and his hand was restored. 
6:11 But they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus. 
6:12 And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God.
6:13 And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles: 
6:14 Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew, 
6:15 and Matthew and Thomas, and James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, 
6:16 and Judas [the son] of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor; 
6:17 and he came down with them, and stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, 
6:18 who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were healed. 
6:19 And all the multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and healed [them] all.
6:20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed [are] you<sup><small>+</small></sup> poor: For yours<sup><small>+</small></sup> is the kingdom of God.
6:21 Blessed [are] you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who hunger now: For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be filled. Blessed [are] you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who weep now: For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will laugh.
6:22 Blessed are you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, when men will hate you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, And when they will separate you<sup><small>+</small></sup> [from their company], And reproach you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, And cast out your<sup><small>+</small></sup> name as evil, For the Son of Man's sake.
6:23 Rejoice in that day, and leap [for joy]: For look, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> reward is great in heaven; For in the same manner their fathers did to the prophets.
6:24 But woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who are rich! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have received your<sup><small>+</small></sup> consolation.
6:25 Woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who are full now! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will hunger. Woe [to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>], you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who laugh now! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will mourn and weep.
6:26 Woe [to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>], when all men will speak well of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>! For in the same manner their fathers did to the false prophets.
6:27 But I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who hear, Love your<sup><small>+</small></sup> enemies, do good to those who hate you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, 
6:28 bless those who curse you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, pray for those who despitefully use you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
6:29 To him who strikes you on the [one] cheek offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak don't withhold your coat also. 
6:30 Give to everyone who asks you; and of him who takes away your goods don't ask [for them] back. 
6:31 And as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would that men should do to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, do<sup><small>+</small></sup> to them likewise. 
6:32 And if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> love those who love you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, what thanks do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have? For even sinners love those who love them. 
6:33 For even if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do good to those who do good to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, what thanks do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have? Even sinners do the same. 
6:34 And if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> lend to them of whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hope to receive, what thanks is it to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much. 
6:35 But love your<sup><small>+</small></sup> enemies, and do [them] good, and lend, never despairing; and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> reward will be great, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil. 
6:36 Be<sup><small>+</small></sup> merciful, even as your<sup><small>+</small></sup> Father is merciful. 
6:37 And do not judge, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not be judged: and do not condemn, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not be condemned: release, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be released: 
6:38 give, and it will be given to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will give into your<sup><small>+</small></sup> bosom. For with what measure you<sup><small>+</small></sup> mete it will be measured to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> again.
6:39 And he spoke also a parable to them, Can the blind guide the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit? 
6:40 The disciple is not above his teacher: but everyone when he is fully trained will be as his teacher. 
6:41 And why do you look at the mote that is in your brother's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye? 
6:42 How can you say to your brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in your eye, when you yourself don't look at the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to cast out the mote that is in your brother's eye.
6:43 For there is no good tree producing corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree producing good fruit. 
6:44 For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush do they gather grapes. 
6:45 The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and the evil [man] out of the evil [treasure] brings forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
6:46 And why call<sup><small>+</small></sup> me, Lord, Lord, and not do the things which I say? 
6:47 Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to whom he is like: 
6:48 he is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock: and when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it: because it had been well built. 
6:49 But he who hears [my words], and does not [do them], is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation; against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell in; and the ruin of that house was great. 
7:1 After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum. 
7:2 And a certain captain's slave, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death. 
7:3 And when he heard concerning Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his slave. 
7:4 And they, when they came to Jesus, implored him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that you should do this for him; 
7:5 for he loves our nation, and himself built us our synagogue. 
7:6 And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the captain sent friends, saying to him, Lord, don't trouble yourself; for I am not worthy that you should come under my roof: 
7:7 therefore neither did I think myself worthy to come to you: but say the word, and let my [young] slave be healed. 
7:8 For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it. 
7:9 And when Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude that followed him, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I haven't found so great faith, no, not in Israel. 
7:10 And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the slave whole.
7:11 And it came to pass soon afterward, that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great multitude. 
7:12 Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, look, there was carried out one who was dead, the only begotten son of his mother, and she was a widow: and many people of the city were with her. 
7:13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, Do not weep. 
7:14 And he came near and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to you, Arise. 
7:15 And he who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother. 
7:16 And fear took hold on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has arisen among us: and, God has visited his people. 
7:17 And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judea, and all the surrounding region.
7:18 And the disciples of John told him of all these things. And John calling to him two of his disciples, 
7:19 sent them to the Lord, saying, Are you he who comes, or do we look for another? 
7:20 And when the men had come to him, they said, John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you he who comes, or do we look for another? 
7:21 In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and on many who were blind he bestowed sight. 
7:22 And he answered and said to them, Go and tell John the things which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have seen and heard; the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them. 
7:23 And blessed is he, whoever will find no occasion of stumbling in me.
7:24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken with the wind? 
7:25 But what did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Look, those who are gorgeously appareled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts. 
7:26 But what did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and much more than a prophet. 
7:27 This is he of whom it is written, Look, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you. 
7:28 I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Among those who are born of women there is none greater than John: yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
7:29 And all the people when they heard, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. 
7:30 But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God, not being baptized of him. 
7:31 To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like? 
7:32 They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another; who say, We piped to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not dance; we wailed, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not weep. 
7:33 For John the Baptist has come eating no bread nor drinking wine; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, He has a demon. 
7:34 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, Look, a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! 
7:35 And wisdom is acknowledged as right by all her children.
7:36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat. 
7:37 And look, a woman who was in the city, a sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment, 
7:38 and standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. 
7:39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he spoke to himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is who touches him, that she's a sinner. 
7:40 And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to you. And he says, Teacher, say on. 
7:41 A certain lender had two debtors: the one owed 500 denarii, and the other 50 [denarii]. 
7:42 When they did not have [that with which] to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most? 
7:43 Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. And he said to him, You have rightly judged. 
7:44 And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, you gave me no water for my feet: but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair. 
7:45 You gave me no kiss: but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. 
7:46 You did not anoint my head with oil: but she has anointed my feet with ointment. 
7:47 Therefore I say to you, Her sins which have been forgiven are many, for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, [the same] loves little. 
7:48 And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven. 
7:49 And those who sat to eat with him began to say to themselves, Who is this that even forgives sins? 
7:50 And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.
8:1 And it came to pass soon afterward, that he went about through cities and villages, proclaiming and preaching [the good news about] the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve, 
8:2 and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary that was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, 
8:3 and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who were serving them out of their substance.
8:4 And when a great multitude came together, and they of every city resorted to him, he spoke by a parable: 
8:5 The sower went forth to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it. 
8:6 And other fell on the rock; and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture. 
8:7 And other fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew with it, and choked it. 
8:8 And other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he cried, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
8:9 And his disciples asked him what this parable might be. 
8:10 And he said, To you<sup><small>+</small></sup> it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand. 
8:11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. 
8:12 And those by the wayside are the ones who have heard; then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. 
8:13 And those on the rock [are] they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for awhile believe, and in time of trial fall away. 
8:14 And that which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of [this] life, and bring no fruit to perfection. 
8:15 And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience. 
8:16 And no man, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a lampstand, that those who enter in may see the light. 
8:17 For nothing is hid, that will not be made manifest; nor [anything] secret, that will not be known and come to light. 
8:18 Take heed therefore how you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hear: for whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever does not have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.
8:19 And there came to him his mother and brothers, and they could not come at him for the crowd. 
8:20 And it was told him, Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you. 
8:21 But he answered and said to them, My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it.
8:22 Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake: and they launched forth. 
8:23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling [with water], and were in jeopardy. 
8:24 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. 
8:25 And he said to them, Where is your<sup><small>+</small></sup> faith? And being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him? 
8:26 And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is across from Galilee.
8:27 And when he came forth on the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and did not stay in [any] house, but in the tombs. 
8:28 And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I urge you, don't torment me. 
8:29 For he commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the deserts. 
8:30 And Jesus asked him, What is your name? And he said, Legion; for many demons went into him. 
8:31 And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss. 
8:32 Now there was there a herd of many swine being shepherded on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave. 
8:33 And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned.
8:34 And when those who shepherded them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country. 
8:35 And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons went out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid. 
8:36 And those who saw it told them how he who was possessed with demons was made whole. 
8:37 And all the people around the country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them; for they were held with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned. 
8:38 But the man from whom the demons had gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying, 
8:39 Return to your house, and declare how much God has done for you. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.
8:40 And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him. 
8:41 And look, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and implored him to come into his house; 
8:42 for he had an only begotten daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him.
8:43 And a woman having a discharge of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, unable to be healed by anyone, 
8:44 came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the discharge of her blood stopped. 
8:45 And Jesus said, Who is it that touched me? And when all denied, Peter said, Master, the multitudes press you and crush [you]. 
8:46 But Jesus said, Someone did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me. 
8:47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately. 
8:48 And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace.
8:49 While he yet spoke, there comes one from the ruler of the synagogue's [house], saying, Your daughter is dead; Don't trouble the Teacher any longer. 
8:50 But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Don't be afraid: only believe, and she will be made whole. 
8:51 And when he came to the house, he didn't allow any man to enter in with him, except Peter, and John, and James, and the girl's father and her mother. 
8:52 And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Do not weep; for she is not dead, but sleeps. 
8:53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. 
8:54 But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Girl, arise. 
8:55 And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that [something] be given her to eat. 
8:56 And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done.
9:1 And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. 
9:2 And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. 
9:3 And he said to them, Take nothing for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> journey, neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats each. 
9:4 And into whatever house you<sup><small>+</small></sup> enter, there stay, and from there depart. 
9:5 And as many as do not receive you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> depart from that city, shake off the dust from your<sup><small>+</small></sup> feet for a testimony against them. 
9:6 And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the good news, and healing everywhere.
9:7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead; 
9:8 and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. 
9:9 But Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
9:10 And the apostles, when they returned, declared to him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida. 
9:11 But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and those who had need of healing he cured.
9:12 And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and country, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place. 
9:13 But he said to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> give them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish; except we should go and buy food for all this people. 
9:14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each. 
9:15 And they did so, and made them all sit down. 
9:16 And he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. 
9:17 And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.
9:18 And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am? 
9:19 And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others [say], Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets has risen again. 
9:20 And he said to them, But who do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God. 
9:21 But he charged them, and commanded [them] to tell this to no man; 
9:22 saying, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. 
9:23 And he said to all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. 
9:24 For whoever would save his soul will lose it; but whoever will lose his soul for my sake, the same will save it. 
9:25 For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self? 
9:26 For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his own glory, and [the glory] of the Father, and of the holy angels. 
9:27 But I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup> of a truth, There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the kingdom of God.
9:28 And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray. 
9:29 And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment [became] white [and] dazzling. 
9:30 And look, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah; 
9:31 who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. 
9:32 Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him. 
9:33 And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said. 
9:34 And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. 
9:35 And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, the chosen one: hear<sup><small>+</small></sup> him. 
9:36 And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen. 
9:37 And it came to pass, on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
9:38 And look, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I urge you to look at my son; for he is my only begotten: 
9:39 and look, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it tears him that he foams, and it harshly departs from him, bruising him intensely. 
9:40 And I implored your disciples to cast it out; and they could not. 
9:41 And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and bear with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? Bring your son here. 
9:42 And as he was yet coming, the demon dashed him down, and tore [him] grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. 
9:43 And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which he did, he said to his disciples, 
9:44 Let these words sink into your<sup><small>+</small></sup> ears: for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men. 
9:45 But they didn't understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
9:46 And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them might be the greatest. 
9:47 But Jesus knowing the reasoning of their heart, took a little child, and set him by his side, 
9:48 and said to them, Whoever will receive this little child in my name receives me: and whoever will receive me receives him who sent me: for he who is least among all of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, the same is great. 
9:49 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us. 
9:50 But Jesus said to him, Don't forbid [him]: for he who is not against you<sup><small>+</small></sup> is for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
9:51 And it came to pass, when the days were well-near come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 
9:52 and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to prepare for him. 
9:53 And they did not receive him, because his face was [as though he were] going to Jerusalem. 
9:54 And when the disciples James and John saw [this], they said, Lord, do you want us to bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them? 
9:55 But he turned, and rebuked them. 
9:56 And they went to another village.
9:57 And as they went on the way, a certain man said to him, I will follow you wherever you go. 
9:58 And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven [have] nests; but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head. 
9:59 And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father. 
9:60 But he said to him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go you and publish abroad the kingdom of God. 
9:61 And another also said, I will follow you, Lord; but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house. 
9:62 But Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
10:1 Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy-two others, and sent them two by two before his face into every city and place, where he himself was about to come. 
10:2 And he said to them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the workers are few: pray<sup><small>+</small></sup> therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth workers into his harvest. 
10:3 Go your<sup><small>+</small></sup> ways; look, I send you<sup><small>+</small></sup> forth as lambs among wolves. 
10:4 Carry no wallet, no bag, no sandals; and greet no man on the way. 
10:5 And into whatever house you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will enter, first say, Peace [be] to this house. 
10:6 And if a son of peace be there, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> peace will rest on him: but if not, it will turn to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> again. 
10:7 And stay in that same house, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the worker is worthy of his wages. Don't go from house to house. 
10:8 And into whatever city you<sup><small>+</small></sup> enter, and they receive you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, eat such things as are set before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: 
10:9 and heal the sick who are in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
10:10 But into whatever city you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will enter, and they do not receive you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, go out into its streets and say, 
10:11 Even the dust from your<sup><small>+</small></sup> city, that sticks to our feet, we wipe off against you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near. 
10:12 I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, It will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.
10:13 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 
10:14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
10:15 And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to Hades. 
10:16 He who hears you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hears me; and he who rejects you<sup><small>+</small></sup> rejects me; and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.
10:17 And the seventy-two returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name. 
10:18 And he said to them, I watched Satan fallen as lightning from heaven. 
10:19 Look, I have given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing will in any wise hurt you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
10:20 Nevertheless don't rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; but rejoice that your<sup><small>+</small></sup> names are written in heaven.
10:21 In that same hour he said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to juveniles: yes, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in your sight. 
10:22 All things have been delivered to me of my Father: and no one knows who the Son is, except the Father; and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son wills to reveal [him]. 
10:23 And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed [are] the eyes which see the things that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see: 
10:24 for I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see, and did not see them; and to hear the things which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hear, and did not hear them.
10:25 And look, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
10:26 And he said to him, What is written in the law? How do you read [it]? 
10:27 And answering he said, You will love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your fellow man as yourself. 
10:28 And he said to him, You have answered right: do this, and you will live. 
10:29 But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my fellow man?
10:30 Jesus replying said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. 
10:31 And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. 
10:32 And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. 
10:33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion, 
10:34 and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on [them] oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. 
10:35 And on the next day he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatever you spend more, I, when I come back again, will repay you. 
10:36 Which of these three, do you think, had been the fellow man of him who fell among the robbers? 
10:37 And he said, He who showed mercy on him. And Jesus said to him, Go, and you do likewise.
10:38 Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him. 
10:39 And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord's feet, and heard his word. 
10:40 But Martha was cumbered about much service; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, don't you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Then tell her to help me. 
10:41 But the Lord answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and upset about many things: 
10:42 but one thing is needful: for Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.
11:1 And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples. 
11:2 And he said to them, When you<sup><small>+</small></sup> pray, say, Father, Hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. 
11:3 Give us day by day our daily bread. 
11:4 And forgive us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation.
11:5 And he said to them, Which of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves; 
11:6 for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him; 
11:7 and he from inside will answer and say, Don't trouble me: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I can't rise and give you. 
11:8 I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needs. 
11:9 And I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Ask, and it will be given you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; seek, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will find; knock, and it will be opened to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
11:10 For everyone who asks receives; and he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks it will be opened. 
11:11 And of which of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who is a father will his son ask for a fish, and he for a fish gives him a serpent? 
11:12 Or [if] he will ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion? 
11:13 If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> children, how much more will [your<sup><small>+</small></sup>] heavenly Father give good [things] to those who ask him.
11:14 And he was casting out a demon, and it was mute. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled. 
11:15 But some of them said, By Beelzebul the prince of the demons he casts out demons. 
11:16 And others, trying [him], sought of him a sign from heaven. 
11:17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house [divided] against a house falls. 
11:18 And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. 
11:19 And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your<sup><small>+</small></sup> judges. 
11:20 But, if by the finger of God I cast out demons, then has the kingdom of God come upon you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
11:21 When the strong [man] fully armed guards his own court, his goods are in peace: 
11:22 but when a stronger than he will come upon him, and overcome him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils. 
11:23 He who is not with me is against me; and he who does not gather with me scatters.
11:24 When the unclean spirit goes out of the man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest and not finding [any]. Then it says, I will turn back to my house from where I came out. 
11:25 And when it comes, it finds it swept and garnished. 
11:26 Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more evil than itself; and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.
11:27 And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts that nursed you. 
11:28 But he said, On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.
11:29 And when the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, This generation is an evil generation: it seeks after a sign; and there will be no sign given to it but the sign of Jonah. 
11:30 For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation. 
11:31 The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and look, a greater than Solomon is here. 
11:32 The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and look, a greater than Jonah is here.
11:33 No man, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar, neither under the bushel, but on the lampstand, that those which enter in may see the light. 
11:34 The lamp of your body is your eye: when your eye is single, your whole body also is full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness. 
11:35 Look therefore whether the light that is in you is not darkness. 
11:36 If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no dark part, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.
11:37 Now as he spoke, a Pharisee asks him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. 
11:38 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner. 
11:39 And the Lord said to him, Now you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your<sup><small>+</small></sup> inward part is full of extortion and wickedness. 
11:40 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> foolish ones, did not he who made the outside make the inside also? 
11:41 But clean those things which are inside; and look, all of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> is clean. 
11:42 But woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> Pharisees! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> tithe mint and dill and every herb, and pass over justice and the love of God: but these you<sup><small>+</small></sup> ought to have done, and not to neglect the others. 
11:43 Woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> Pharisees! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the marketplaces. 
11:44 Woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are as the tombs which do not appear, and the men who walk over [them] do not know it. 
11:45 And one of the lawyers answering says to him, Teacher, in saying this you reproach us also.
11:46 And he said, Woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> lawyers also! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> load men with loads grievous to be borne, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> yourselves don't touch the loads with one of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fingers. 
11:47 Woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> build the tombs of the prophets, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers killed them. 
11:48 So you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are witnesses and give your<sup><small>+</small></sup> approval to the works of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers: for they killed them, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> build [their tombs]. 
11:49 Therefore the wisdom of God also said, I will send to them prophets and apostles; and [some] of them they will kill and persecute; 
11:50 that the blood of all the prophets, having been shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; 
11:51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary: yes, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, it will be required of this generation. 
11:52 Woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> lawyers! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> took away the key of knowledge: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> didn't enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hindered. 
11:53 And when he came out from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press on [him] vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things; 
11:54 laying wait for him, to catch something out of his mouth.
12:1 In the mean time, when the tens of thousands of the multitude were gathered together, insomuch that they trod one on another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, Take heed to yourselves [and stay away] from the leaven which is the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. 
12:2 But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed; and hid, that will not be known. 
12:3 Therefore whatever you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have said in the darkness will be heard in the light; and what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops.
12:4 And I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> my friends, Don't be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. 
12:5 But I will warn you<sup><small>+</small></sup> whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will fear: Fear him, who after he has killed has power to cast into hell; yes, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Fear him. 
12:6 Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria? and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God. 
12:7 But the very hairs of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> head are all numbered. Don't be afraid: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are of more value than many sparrows.
12:8 And I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Everyone who will confess me before men, the Son of Man will also confess him before the angels of God: 
12:9 but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God. 
12:10 And everyone who will speak a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him: but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit it will not be forgiven. 
12:11 And when they bring you<sup><small>+</small></sup> before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, don't be anxious how or what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will answer, or what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will say: 
12:12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in that very hour what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> ought to say.
12:13 And one out of the multitude said to him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me. 
12:14 But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? 
12:15 And he said to them, Take heed, and keep yourselves from all greed: for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of the things which he possesses.
12:16 And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: 
12:17 and he reasoned to himself, saying, What shall I do, because I don't have a place to bestow my fruits? 
12:18 And he said, I will do this: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there I will bestow all my grain and my goods. 
12:19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry. 
12:20 But God said to him, You foolish one, this [is] the night they demand back your soul from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be? 
12:21 So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
12:22 And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Don't be anxious for [your<sup><small>+</small></sup>] soul, what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will eat; nor yet for [your<sup><small>+</small></sup>] body, what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will put on. 
12:23 For the soul is more than the food, and the body than the clothing. 
12:24 Consider the ravens, that they do not sow, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn; and God feeds them: of how much more value are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> than the birds! 
12:25 And which of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> by being anxious can add a cubit to the measure of his life? 
12:26 If then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are not able to do even that which is least, why are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> anxious concerning the rest? 
12:27 Consider the lilies, how they grow: they do not toil, neither do they spin; yet I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 
12:28 But if God so clothes the grass in the field, which today is [here], and tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more [he will clothe] you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, O you<sup><small>+</small></sup> of little faith? 
12:29 And don't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> seek what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will eat, and what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will drink, neither be<sup><small>+</small></sup> of doubtful mind. 
12:30 For all these things the nations of the world seek after: but your<sup><small>+</small></sup> Father knows that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have need of these things. 
12:31 Yet seek<sup><small>+</small></sup> his kingdom, and these things will be added to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
12:32 Don't be afraid, little flock; for it is your<sup><small>+</small></sup> Father's good pleasure to give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the kingdom. 
12:33 Sell that which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have, and give alms; make for yourselves wallets which do not wear out, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief draws near, neither moth destroys. 
12:34 For where your<sup><small>+</small></sup> treasure is, there will your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart be also.
12:35 Let your<sup><small>+</small></sup> loins be girded about, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> lamps burning; 
12:36 and be<sup><small>+</small></sup> yourselves like men looking for their lord, when he will return from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may right away open to him. 
12:37 Blessed are those slaves, whom the lord when he comes will find watching: truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that he will gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and will come and serve them. 
12:38 And if he will come in the second watch, and if in the third, and find [them] so, blessed are those [slaves]. 
12:39 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken through. 
12:40 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> also be ready: for in an hour that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not think the Son of Man comes.
12:41 And Peter said, Lord, do you speak this parable to us, or even to all? 
12:42 And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season? 
12:43 Blessed is that slave, whom his lord when he comes will find so doing. 
12:44 Of a truth I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that he will set him over all that he has. 
12:45 But if that slave will say in his heart, My lord delays his coming; and will begin to beat the male slaves and the female slaves, and to eat and drink, and to be drunk; 
12:46 the lord of that slave will come in a day when he does not expect, and in an hour when he does not know, and will cut him apart, and appoint his portion with the unfaithful. 
12:47 And that slave, who knew his lord's will, and did not prepare, nor did according to his will, will be beaten with many [stripes]; 
12:48 but he who did not know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few [stripes]. And to whomever much is given, of him will much be required: and to whom they commit much, of him they will ask the more.
12:49 I came to cast fire on the earth; and how I want that it were already kindled! 
12:50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how I am straitened until it is accomplished! 
12:51 Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, No; but rather division: 
12:52 for there will be from now on five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. 
12:53 They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law.
12:54 And he said to the multitudes also, When you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see the cloud rising in the west, right away you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, There comes a shower; and so it comes to pass. 
12:55 And when [you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see] a south wind blowing, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, There will be a scorching heat; and it comes to pass. 
12:56 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> hypocrites, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven; but how is it that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't know how to interpret this time?
12:57 And why even of yourselves don't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> judge what is right? 
12:58 For as you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, on the way work hard to be released from him; lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge will deliver you to the officer, and the officer will cast you into prison. 
12:59 I say to you, You will by no means come out from there, until you have paid the very last lepton.
13:1 Now there were some present at that very season who told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 
13:2 And he answered and said to them, Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> think that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they have suffered these things? 
13:3 I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, No: but, except you<sup><small>+</small></sup> repent, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will all in like manner perish. 
13:4 Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> think that they were offenders above all the men who dwell in Jerusalem? 
13:5 I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, No: but, except you<sup><small>+</small></sup> repent, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will all likewise perish. 
13:6 And he spoke this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none. 
13:7 And he said to the vinedresser, Look, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: therefore cut it down; why does it also cumber the ground? 
13:8 And answering he says to him, Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I will dig about it, and dung it: 
13:9 and if it bears fruit from then on, [very well]; but if not, you will cut it down.
13:10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day. 
13:11 And look, a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and could in no way lift herself up. 
13:12 And when Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity. 
13:13 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. 
13:14 And the ruler of the synagogue, being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the day of the Sabbath. 
13:15 But the Lord answered him, and said, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> hypocrites, does not each of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> on the Sabbath loose his ox or his donkey from the stall, and lead him away to watering? 
13:16 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, look, [these] eighteen years, to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the Sabbath? 
13:17 And as he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
13:18 He said therefore, To what is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I liken it? 
13:19 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the heaven lodged in its branches. 
13:20 And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God? 
13:21 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened. 
13:22 And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and journeying on to Jerusalem.
13:23 And one said to him, Lord, are there few who are saved? And he said to them, 
13:24 Strive to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, will seek to enter in, and will not be able. 
13:25 When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut to the door, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he will answer and say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I don't know you<sup><small>+</small></sup> or where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are from. 
13:26 Then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will begin to say, We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets; 
13:27 and he will speak, saying to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I don't know you<sup><small>+</small></sup> or where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are from; depart from me, all you<sup><small>+</small></sup> workers of iniquity. 
13:28 There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth outside. 
13:29 And they will come from the east and west, and from the north and south, and will sit down in the kingdom of God. 
13:30 And look, there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.
13:31 In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get out, and go from here: for Herod wants to kill you. 
13:32 And he said to them, Go and say to that fox, Look, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third [day] I am perfected. 
13:33 Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the [day] following: for it cannot be that a prophet perishes out of Jerusalem. 
13:34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, even as a hen [gathers] her own brood under her wings, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not want [to]! 
13:35 Look, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> house is left to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: and I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not see me until the time comes when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will say, Blessed [is] he who comes in the name of Yahweh.
14:1 And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.
14:2 And look, there was before him a certain man who had the dropsy. 
14:3 And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not? 
14:4 But they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go. 
14:5 And he said to them, Which of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will have a son or an ox fallen into a well, and will not immediately draw him up on a Sabbath day? 
14:6 And they could not answer again to these things.
14:7 And he spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying to them, 
14:8 When you are invited of any man to a marriage feast, don't sit down in the chief seat; lest perhaps a more honorable man than you be invited of him, 
14:9 and he who invited you and him will come and say to you, Give this man place; and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. 
14:10 But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he who has invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher: then you will have glory in the presence of all who sit at meat with you. 
14:11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled; and he who humbles himself will be exalted. 
14:12 And he said to him also who had invited him, When you make a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest perhaps they also bid you again, and a recompense be made you. 
14:13 But when you make a feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: 
14:14 and you will be blessed; because they don't have [the means] to recompense you: for you will be recompensed in the resurrection of the just. 
14:15 And when one of those who sat to eat with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he who will eat bread in the kingdom of God.
14:16 But he said to him, A certain man made a great supper; and he invited many: 
14:17 and he sent forth his slave at supper time to say to those who were invited, Come; for [all] things are now ready. 
14:18 And they all with one [consent] began to make excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I must surely go out and see it; I pray you have me excused. 
14:19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray you have me excused. 
14:20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I can't come. 
14:21 And the slave came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his slave, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and maimed and blind and lame. 
14:22 And the slave said, Lord, what you commanded is done, and yet there is room. 
14:23 And the lord said to the slave, Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain [them] to come in, that my house may be filled. 
14:24 For I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.
14:25 Now there went with him great multitudes: and he turned, and said to them, 
14:26 If any man comes to me, and does not hate his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own soul also, he can't be my disciple. 
14:27 Whoever does not bear his own cross, and come after me, can't be my disciple.
14:28 For which of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has [the means] to complete it? 
14:29 Lest perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all who watch begin to mock him, 
14:30 saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. 
14:31 Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? 
14:32 Otherwise, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an ambassador, and asks the [conditions] of peace. 
14:33 So therefore whoever he is of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who does not renounce all that he has, he can't be my disciple. 
14:34 Salt therefore is good: but if even the salt has lost its savor, how will it be seasoned? 
14:35 It is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill: [men] cast it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
15:1 Now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near to him to hear him. 
15:2 And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receives sinners, and eats with them.
15:3 And he spoke to them this parable, saying, 
15:4 What man of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he finds it? 
15:5 And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 
15:6 And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost. 
15:7 I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that even so there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, [more] than over ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no repentance. 
15:8 Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she loses one, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she finds it? 
15:9 And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost. 
15:10 Even so, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.
15:11 And he said, A certain man had two sons: 
15:12 and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of [your] substance that falls to me. And he divided to them his living. 
15:13 And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living. 
15:14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. 
15:15 And he went and stuck [close] to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to shepherd swine. 
15:16 And he desired to have filled his belly with the pods that the swine ate: and no man gave to him. 
15:17 But when he came to himself he said, How many hired workers of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger! 
15:18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight: 
15:19 I am no more worthy to be called your son: make me as one of your hired workers. 
15:20 And he arose, and came to his father. But while he was yet far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. 
15:21 And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight: I am no more worthy to be called your son. 
15:22 But the father said to his slaves, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet: 
15:23 and bring the fatted calf, [and] kill it, and let us eat, and make merry: 
15:24 for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
15:25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. 
15:26 And he called to him one of the [household] slaves, and inquired what these things might be. 
15:27 And he said to him, Your brother has come; and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound. 
15:28 But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came out, and entreated him. 
15:29 But he answered and said to his father, Look, these many years I serve you as a slave, and I never transgressed a commandment of yours; and [yet] you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends: 
15:30 but when this your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed for him the fatted calf. 
15:31 And he said to him, Child, you are ever with me, and all that is mine is yours. 
15:32 But it was meet to make merry and be glad: for this your brother was dead, and is alive [again]; and [was] lost, and is found.
16:1 And he said also to the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he was wasting his goods. 
16:2 And he called him, and said to him, What is this that I hear of you? Render the account of your stewardship; for you can no longer be steward. 
16:3 And the steward said to himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord takes away the stewardship from me? I don't have strength to dig; I am ashamed to beg. 
16:4 I have resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. 
16:5 And calling to him each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much do you owe to my lord? 
16:6 And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty. 
16:7 Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He says to him, Take your bond, and write eighty. 
16:8 And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this age are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light. 
16:9 And I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it will fail, they may receive you<sup><small>+</small></sup> into the eternal tabernacles. 
16:10 He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he who is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much. 
16:11 If therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> haven't been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> trust the true [riches]? 
16:12 And if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> haven't been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> that which is your<sup><small>+</small></sup> own? 
16:13 No household slave can serve as a slave to two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will hold to one, and despise the other. You<sup><small>+</small></sup> can't serve as a slave to God and mammon.
16:14 And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him. 
16:15 And he said to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knows your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts: for that which is exalted among men is disgusting in the sight of God.
16:16 The law and the prophets [were] until John: from that time the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man enters violently into it. 
16:17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall. 
16:18 Everyone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery: and he who marries her who has been divorced from a husband commits adultery.
16:19 Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day: 
16:20 and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores, 
16:21 and desiring to be fed with the [crumbs] that fell from the rich man's table; yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores. 
16:22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham's bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried. 
16:23 And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and sees Abraham far off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 
16:24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame. 
16:25 But Abraham said, Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and you are in anguish. 
16:26 And besides all this, between us and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> there is a great gulf fixed, that those who would pass from here to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may not be able, and that none may cross over from there to us. 
16:27 And he said, I pray you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house; 
16:28 for I have five brothers; that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment. 
16:29 But Abraham says, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 
16:30 And he said, No, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent. 
16:31 And he said to him, If they don't hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one would rise from the dead.
17:1 And he said to his disciples, It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe to him, through whom they come! 
17:2 It were well for him if a millstone were put around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble. 
17:3 Take heed to yourselves: if your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. 
17:4 And if he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times turn again to you, saying, I repent; you will forgive him. 
17:5 And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith. 
17:6 And the Lord said, If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would say to this sycamine tree, Be rooted up, and be planted in the sea; and it would obey you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
17:7 But who is there of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, having a slave plowing or shepherding, that will say to him, when he has come in from the field, Come right away and sit down to meat; 
17:8 and will not rather say to him, Prepare [that] with which I may sup, and gird yourself, and serve me, until I have eaten and drank; and afterward you will eat and drink? 
17:9 Does he thank the slave because he did the things that were commanded? 
17:10 Even so you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will have done all the things that are commanded you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done that which it was our duty to do.
17:11 And it came to pass, as they were on the way to Jerusalem, that he was passing through between the borders of Samaria and Galilee. 
17:12 And as he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood far off: 
17:13 and they lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. 
17:14 And when he saw them, he said to them, Go and show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed. 
17:15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God; 
17:16 and he fell on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. 
17:17 And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? But where are the nine? 
17:18 Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, except this stranger? 
17:19 And he said to him, Arise, and go your way: your faith has made you whole.
17:20 And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation: 
17:21 neither will they say, Look, here! Or, There! For look, the kingdom of God is inside you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
17:22 And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not see it. 
17:23 And they will say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Look, there! Or, Look, here! Don't go away, nor follow after [them]: 
17:24 for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the heaven, shines to the other part under heaven; so will the Son of Man be in his day. 
17:25 But first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation. 
17:26 And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man. 
17:27 They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. 
17:28 Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; 
17:29 but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all: 
17:30 after the same manner it will be in the day that the Son of Man is revealed. 
17:31 In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him who is in the field likewise not return back. 
17:32 Remember Lot's wife. 
17:33 Whoever will seek to gain his soul will lose it: but whoever will lose [his soul] will preserve it. 
17:34 I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, In that night there will be two men on one bed; the one will be taken, and the other will be left. 
17:35 There will be two women grinding together; the one will be taken, and the other will be left. 
17:37 And answering they say to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Where the body [is], there will the eagles also be gathered together.
18:1 And he spoke a parable to them to the end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint; 
18:2 saying, There was in a city a judge, who didn't fear God, and didn't regard man: 
18:3 and there was a widow in that city; and she came often to him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary. 
18:4 And he would not for awhile: but after these things he said to himself, Though I don't fear God, nor regard man; 
18:5 yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest she wear me out by her continual coming. 
18:6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge says. 
18:7 And will not God avenge his elect, that cry to him day and night, and [yet] he is long-suffering over them? 
18:8 I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?
18:9 And he spoke also this parable to certain ones, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nothing: 
18:10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 
18:11 The Pharisee stood and prayed these things to himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. 
18:12 I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get. 
18:13 But the publican, standing far off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but struck his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner. 
18:14 I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled; but he who humbles himself will be exalted.
18:15 And they were bringing to him also their babies, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 
18:16 But Jesus called them to him, saying, Allow the little children to come to me, and don't forbid them: for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 
18:17 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he will in no way enter in it.
18:18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
18:19 And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? None is good but one, God. 
18:20 You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother. 
18:21 And he said, All these things I have observed from youth. 
18:22 And when Jesus heard it, he said to him, One thing you lack yet: sell all that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. 
18:23 But when he heard these things, he became exceedingly sorrowful; for he was very rich. 
18:24 And Jesus seeing him become exceedingly sorrowful said, How hard it is for those having riches to enter into the kingdom of God! 
18:25 For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
18:26 And those who heard it said, Then who can be saved? 
18:27 But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. 
18:28 And Peter said, Look, we have left our own, and followed you. 
18:29 And he said to them, Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, There is no man who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, 
18:30 who will not receive manifold more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.
18:31 And he took to him the twelve, and said to them, Look, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets will be accomplished to the Son of Man. 
18:32 For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, and will be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit on: 
18:33 and they will scourge and kill him: and the third day he will rise again. 
18:34 And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, and they didn't perceive the things that were said.
18:35 And it came to pass, as he drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging: 
18:36 and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this might be. 
18:37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passes by. 
18:38 And he cried out, saying, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me. 
18:39 And those who went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Son of David, have mercy on me. 
18:40 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he came near, he asked him, 
18:41 What do you want that I should do to you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. 
18:42 And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight: your faith has made you whole. 
18:43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
19:1 And he entered and was passing through Jericho. 
19:2 And look, a man called by name Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich. 
19:3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature. 
19:4 And he ran on before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. 
19:5 And when he came to the place, Jesus looked up, and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry, and come down; for today I must stay at your house. 
19:6 And he hurried, and came down, and received him joyfully. 
19:7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner. 
19:8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord, Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted anything of any man, I restore fourfold. 
19:9 And Jesus said to him, Today has salvation come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. 
19:10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost. 
19:11 And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and [because] they supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear.
19:12 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. 
19:13 And he called ten slaves of his, and gave them ten minas, and said to them, Trade<sup><small>+</small></sup> until I come. 
19:14 But his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassador after him, saying, We will not have this man reign over us. 
19:15 And it came to pass, when he came back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these slaves, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading. 
19:16 And the first came before him, saying, Lord, your mina has made ten minas more. 
19:17 And he said to him, Well done, you good slave: because you were found faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities. 
19:18 And the second came, saying, Your mina, Lord, has made five minas. 
19:19 And he said to him also, You also be over five cities. 
19:20 And another came, saying, Lord, look, [here is] your mina, which I kept laid up in a napkin: 
19:21 for I feared you, because you are an austere man: you take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow. 
19:22 He says to him, Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked slave. You knew that I am an austere man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow; 
19:23 then why didn't you give my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have collected it with interest? 
19:24 And he said to those who stood by, Take away from him the mina, and give it to him who has the ten minas. 
19:25 And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas. 
19:26 I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that to everyone who has will be given; but from him who has not, even that which he has will be taken away. 
19:27 But these enemies of mine, who did not want that I should reign over them, bring here, and slay them before me. 
19:28 And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.
19:29 And it came to pass, when he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called, of Olives, he sent two of the disciples, 
19:30 saying, Go your<sup><small>+</small></sup> way into the village across from [you<sup><small>+</small></sup>]; in which as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> enter you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will find a colt tied, on which no man ever yet sat: and having loosed him, bring him. 
19:31 And if anyone asks you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> loose him? Thus you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will say, The Lord has need of him. 
19:32 And those who were sent, went away, and found even as he had said to them. 
19:33 And as they were loosing the colt, its owners said to them, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> loose the colt? 
19:34 And they said, The Lord has need of him. 
19:35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments on the colt, and set Jesus on it. 
19:36 And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.
19:37 And as he was now drawing near, [even] at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen; 
19:38 saying, Blessed [is] he who comes, the King, in the name of Yahweh: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. 
19:39 And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples. 
19:40 And he answered and said, I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, if these will hold their peace, the stones will cry out.
19:41 And when he drew near, he saw the city and wept over it, 
19:42 saying, If you had known in this day, even you, the things which belong to peace! But now they are hid from your eyes. 
19:43 For the days will come upon you, when your enemies will cast up a bank about you, and circle you round, and keep you in on every side, 
19:44 and will dash you to the ground, and your children inside you; and they will not leave in you one stone on another; because you didn't know the time of your visitation.
19:45 And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out those who sold, 
19:46 saying to them, It is written, And my house will be a house of prayer: but you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have made it a den of robbers. 
19:47 And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him: 
19:48 and they could not find what they might do; for the people all hung on him, listening.
20:1 And it came to pass, on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the good news, there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders; 
20:2 and they spoke, saying to him, Tell us: By what authority do you do these things? Or who is he who gave you this authority? 
20:3 And he answered and said to them, I also will ask you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a question; and tell me: 
20:4 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? 
20:5 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we will say, From heaven; he will say, Why didn't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> believe him? 
20:6 But if we will say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet. 
20:7 And they answered, that they didn't know from where [it was]. 
20:8 And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup> by what authority I do these things.
20:9 And he began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country for a long time. 
20:10 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a slave, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty. 
20:11 And he sent yet another slave: and him also they beat, and handled him shamefully, and sent him away empty. 
20:12 And he sent yet a third: and him also they wounded, and cast him forth. 
20:13 And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him. 
20:14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned one with another, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. 
20:15 And they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them? 
20:16 He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid. 
20:17 But he looked on them, and said, What then is this that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner? 
20:18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust. 
20:19 And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he spoke this parable against them.
20:20 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who feigned themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor. 
20:21 And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that you say and teach rightly, and do not accept the person [of any], but of a truth teach the way of God: 
20:22 Is it lawful for us to give tax to Caesar, or not? 
20:23 But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, 
20:24 Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription does it have? And they said, Caesar's. 
20:25 And he said to them, Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. 
20:26 And they were not able to take hold of what he said before the people: and they marveled at his answer, and held their peace.
20:27 And there came to him certain of the Sadducees, those denying that there is a resurrection; 
20:28 and they asked him, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that if a man's brother dies, having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed to his brother. 
20:29 There were therefore seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died childless; 
20:30 and the second: 
20:31 and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died. 
20:32 Afterward the woman also died. 
20:33 Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife of them will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife. 
20:34 And Jesus said to them, The sons of this age marry, and are given in marriage: 
20:35 but those who are accounted worthy to attain to that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: 
20:36 for neither can they die anymore: for they are equal to the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. 
20:37 But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in [the place concerning] the bush, when he calls Yahweh the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. 
20:38 Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him. 
20:39 And certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, you have said well. 
20:40 For they didn't dare anymore ask him any question.
20:41 And he said to them, How do they say that the Christ is David's son? 
20:42 For David himself says in the Book of Psalms, Yahweh said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, 
20:43 Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet. 
20:44 David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?
20:45 And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples, 
20:46 Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts; 
20:47 who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater condemnation.
21:1 And he looked up, and saw the rich men who were casting their gifts into the treasury. 
21:2 And he saw a certain poor widow casting in there two lepta. 
21:3 And he said, Of a truth I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, This poor widow cast in more than all of them: 
21:4 for all these of their superfluity cast in to the gifts; but she of her want cast in all the living that she had.
21:5 And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings, he said, 
21:6 As for these things which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are looking at, the days will come, in which there will not be left one stone on another, that will not be thrown down.
21:7 And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when therefore will these things be? And what [will be] the sign when these things are about to come to pass? 
21:8 And he said, Take heed that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are not led astray: for many will come in my name, saying, I am [he]; and, The time is at hand: don't go<sup><small>+</small></sup> after them. 
21:9 And when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will hear of wars and tumults, don't be terrified: for these things must surely come to pass first; but the end is not immediately. 
21:10 Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; 
21:11 and there will be great earthquakes, and in diverse places famines and pestilences; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. 
21:12 But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and will persecute you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, delivering you<sup><small>+</small></sup> up to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you<sup><small>+</small></sup> before kings and governors for my name's sake. 
21:13 It will turn out to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> for a testimony. 
21:14 Settle it therefore in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts, not to meditate beforehand how to answer: 
21:15 for I will give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a mouth and wisdom, which all your<sup><small>+</small></sup> adversaries will not be able to withstand or to gainsay. 
21:16 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be delivered up even by parents, and brothers, and kinsfolk, and friends; and [some] of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> they will cause to be put to death. 
21:17 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be hated of all men for my name's sake. 
21:18 And not a hair of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> head will perish. 
21:19 In your<sup><small>+</small></sup> patience you<sup><small>+</small></sup> win your<sup><small>+</small></sup> souls. 
21:20 But when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation is at hand. 
21:21 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let those who are inside her depart out; and don't let those who are in the country enter into her. 
21:22 For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. 
21:23 Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse in those days! For there will be great distress on the land, and wrath to this people. 
21:24 And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations: and Jerusalem will be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
21:25 And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars; and on the earth distress of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows; 
21:26 men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming upon the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 
21:27 And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 
21:28 But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heads; because your<sup><small>+</small></sup> redemption draws near.
21:29 And he spoke to them a parable: Look at the fig tree, and all the trees: 
21:30 when they now shoot forth, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see it and know of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> own selves that the summer is now near. 
21:31 Even so you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see these things coming to pass, know<sup><small>+</small></sup> that the kingdom of God is near. 
21:32 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, This generation will not pass away, until all things be accomplished. 
21:33 Heaven and earth will pass away: but my words will not pass away.
21:34 But take heed to yourselves, lest perhaps your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come upon you<sup><small>+</small></sup> suddenly as a snare: 
21:35 for [so] it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of all the earth. 
21:36 But watch<sup><small>+</small></sup> at every season, making supplication, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may prevail to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.
21:37 And every day he was teaching in the temple; and every night he went out, and lodged in the mount that is called of Olives. 
21:38 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.
22:1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew near, which is called the Passover. 
22:2 And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death; for they feared the people. 
22:3 And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. 
22:4 And he went away, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him to them. 
22:5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 
22:6 And he consented, and sought opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.
22:7 And the day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed. 
22:8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare for us the Passover, that we may eat. 
22:9 And they said to him, Where do you want us to prepare? 
22:10 And he said to them, Look, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have entered into the city, there will meet you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house into which he goes. 
22:11 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guestchamber, where I will eat the Passover with my disciples? 
22:12 And he will show you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a large upper room furnished: there prepare. 
22:13 And they went, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the Passover.
22:14 And when the hour came, he sat down, and the apostles with him. 
22:15 And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> before I suffer: 
22:16 for I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I will not eat it, until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God. 
22:17 And he received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: 
22:18 for I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I will not drink from now on of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God will come. 
22:19 And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: this do in remembrance of me. 
22:20 And the cup in like manner after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, [even] that which is poured out for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
22:21 But look, the hand of him who delivers me up is with me on the table. 
22:22 For the Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined: but woe to that man through whom he is delivered up! 
22:23 And they began to question among themselves, which of them it might be that should participate in this thing.
22:24 And there arose also a contention among them, which of them was accounted to be greatest. 
22:25 And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and those who have authority over them are called Benefactors. 
22:26 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> [will] not [be] so: but he who is the greater among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, let him become as the younger; and he who is chief, as he who serves. 
22:27 For which is greater, he who sits at meat, or he who serves? Isn't it he who sits at meat? But I am among you<sup><small>+</small></sup> as he who serves. 
22:28 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are those who have continued with me in my trials; 
22:29 and I appoint to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, even as my Father appointed to me, a kingdom, 
22:30 that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
22:31 Simon, Simon, look, Satan asked to have you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that he might sift you<sup><small>+</small></sup> as wheat: 
22:32 but I made supplication for you, that your faith does not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers. 
22:33 And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go both to prison and to death with you. 
22:34 And he said, I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you have thrice denied that you know me.
22:35 And he said to them, When I sent you<sup><small>+</small></sup> forth without wallet, and bag, and sandals, did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> lack anything? And they said, Nothing. 
22:36 And he said to them, But now, he who has a wallet, let him take it, and likewise a bag; and he who has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. 
22:37 For I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerns me has fulfillment. 
22:38 And they said, Lord, look, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.
22:39 And he came out, and went, as his custom was, to the mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him. 
22:40 And when he was at the place, he said to them, Pray that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not enter into temptation. 
22:41 And he was parted from them about a stone's cast; and he knelt down and prayed, 
22:42 saying, Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done. 
22:45 And when he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow, 
22:46 and said to them, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> sleep? Rise and pray, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not enter into temptation.
22:47 While he yet spoke, look, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near to Jesus to kiss him. 
22:48 But Jesus said to him, Judas, do you deliver up the Son of Man with a kiss? 
22:49 And when those who were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword? 
22:50 And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest, and took off his right ear. 
22:51 But Jesus answered and said, Allow<sup><small>+</small></sup> [them] thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. 
22:52 And Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that had come upon him, As upon a robber, did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> come out with swords and staves? 
22:53 When I was daily with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the temple, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not stretch forth your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hands against me: but this is your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hour, and the power of darkness.
22:54 And they seized him, and led him [away], and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed far off. 
22:55 And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them. 
22:56 And a certain female slave seeing him as he sat in the light [of the fire], and looking steadfastly on him, said, This man also was with him. 
22:57 But he denied, saying, Woman, I don't know him. 
22:58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, You also are [one] of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not. 
22:59 And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean. 
22:60 But Peter said, Man, I don't know what you say. And immediately, while he yet spoke, the rooster crowed. 
22:61 And the Lord turned, and looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said to him, Before the rooster crows this day you will deny me thrice. 
22:62 And he went out, and wept bitterly.
22:63 And the men who held [Jesus] mocked him, and beat him. 
22:64 And they blindfolded him, and asked, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck you? 
22:65 And many other things they spoke against him, reviling him.
22:66 And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their Sanhedrin, 
22:67 saying, If you are the Christ, tell us. But he said to them, If I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not believe: 
22:68 and if I ask [you<sup><small>+</small></sup>], you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not answer. 
22:69 But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God. 
22:70 And they all said, Are you then the Son of God? And he said to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> say that I am. 
22:71 And they said, What further need do we have of witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.
23:1 And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate. 
23:2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king. 
23:3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, You say. 
23:4 And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man. 
23:5 But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, and beginning from Galilee even to this place.
23:6 But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilean. 
23:7 And when he knew that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days. 
23:8 Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him. 
23:9 And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing. 
23:10 And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.
23:11 And Herod with his soldiers also set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate. 
23:12 And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
23:13 And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
23:14 and said to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> brought to me this man, as one who perverts the people: and look, I, having examined him before you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, found no fault in this man concerning those things of which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> accuse him: 
23:15 no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back to us; and look, he has been participating in nothing worthy of death. 
23:16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him. 
23:18 But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:-- 
23:19 one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison. 
23:20 And Pilate spoke to them again, desiring to release Jesus; 
23:21 but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him. 
23:22 And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil has this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him. 
23:23 But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed. 
23:24 And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done. 
23:25 And he released him who for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will. 
23:26 And when they led him away, they laid hold on one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.
23:27 And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him. 
23:28 But Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> children. 
23:29 For look, the days are coming, in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed. 
23:30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. 
23:31 For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?
23:32 And there were also two others, criminals, led with him to be put to death. 
23:33 And when they came to the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left. 
23:34 And parting his garments among them, they cast lots. 
23:35 And the people stood watching. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen. 
23:36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar, 
23:37 and saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself. 
23:38 And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
23:44 And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour, 
23:45 the sun's light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the middle. 
23:46 And Jesus cried with a loud voice and breathed his last. 
23:49 And the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood far off, seeing these things.
23:50 And look, a man named Joseph, who was a councilor, 
23:51 [a man] of Arimathaea, who was looking for the kingdom of God: 
23:52 this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. 
23:53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where man had never yet lain. 
23:54 And it was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew on. 
23:55 And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and looked at the tomb, and how his body was laid.
24:1 But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing spices. 
24:2 And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb. 
24:3 And they entered in, and did not find the body. 
24:4 And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, look, a man stood by them in white apparel: 
24:5 and as they were frightened, he said to them, 
24:6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> when he was yet in Galilee. 
24:8 And they 
24:9 returned from the tomb.
