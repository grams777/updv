1:1 The burden of the word of Yahweh to Israel by Malachi. 
1:2 I have loved you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, says Yahweh. Yet you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, In what have you loved us? Wasn't Esau Jacob's brother, says Yahweh: yet I loved Jacob; 
1:3 but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and [gave] his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness. 
1:4 Whereas Edom says, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; this is what Yahweh of Hosts says, They will build, but I will throw down; and men will call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Yahweh has indignation forever. 
1:5 And your<sup><small>+</small></sup> eyes will see, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will say, May Yahweh be magnified beyond the border of Israel.
1:6 A son honors his father, and a slave his master: if then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says Yahweh of hosts to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, O priests, that despise my name. And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, In what have we despised your name? 
1:7 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> offer polluted bread on my altar. And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, In what have we polluted you? In that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, The table of Yahweh is contemptible. 
1:8 And when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! And when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now to your governor; will he be pleased with you? Or will he accept your person? says Yahweh of hosts. 
1:9 And now, I pray you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us: this has been by your<sup><small>+</small></sup> means: will he accept any of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> persons? says Yahweh of hosts. 
1:10 Oh that there were one among you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who would shut the doors, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> might not kindle [fire on] my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, says Yahweh of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand. 
1:11 For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name [will be] great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense [will be] offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name [will be] great among the Gentiles, says Yahweh of hosts. 
1:12 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> profane it, in that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, The table of Yahweh is polluted, and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible. 
1:13 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> also say, Look, what a weariness it is! And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have snorted at it, says Yahweh of hosts; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus you<sup><small>+</small></sup> bring the offering: should I accept this at your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand? says Yahweh. 
1:14 But cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, says Yahweh of hosts, and my name is awesome among the Gentiles.
2:1 And now, O you<sup><small>+</small></sup> priests, this commandment is for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
2:2 If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not hear, and if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name, says Yahweh of hosts, then I will send the curse on you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and I will curse your<sup><small>+</small></sup> blessings; yes, I have cursed them already, because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't lay it to heart. 
2:3 Look, I will rebuke your<sup><small>+</small></sup> seed, and will spread feces on your<sup><small>+</small></sup> faces, even the feces of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> feasts; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be taken away with it. 
2:4 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will know that I have sent this commandment to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that my covenant may be with Levi, says Yahweh of hosts. 
2:5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and stood in awe of my name. 
2:6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity. 
2:7 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of hosts. 
2:8 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have turned aside out of the way; you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have caused many to stumble in the law; you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says Yahweh of hosts. 
2:9 Therefore I have also made you<sup><small>+</small></sup> contemptible and base before all the people, according to as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have not kept my ways, but have had respect of persons in the law.
2:10 Don't we all have one father? Has not one God created us? Why do we betray every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers? 
2:11 Judah has betrayed, and a disgusting thing is done in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god. 
2:12 Yahweh will cut off, to the man who does this, him who wakes and him who answers, out of the tents of Jacob, and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of hosts. 
2:13 And this again you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> cover the altar of Yahweh with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he does not regard the offering anymore, neither receives it with goodwill at your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hand. 
2:14 Yet you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, Why? Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, whom you have betrayed, though she is your partner, and the wife of your covenant. 
2:15 And no one who does this has part of the Spirit remaining in him; neither is such a one seeking a godly seed. Therefore take heed<sup><small>+</small></sup> to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> spirit; and do not betray the wife of your youth. 
2:16 For he who hates, divorces, says Yahweh, the God of Israel, and he will cover his garment with violence, says Yahweh of hosts. Therefore take heed to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> spirit, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not betray [the wife of your youth].
2:17 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have wearied Yahweh with your<sup><small>+</small></sup> words. Yet you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, In what have we wearied him? In that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, Everyone who does evil is good in the eyes of Yahweh, and he delights in them; or where is the God of justice? 
3:1 Look, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> desire, look, he comes, says Yahweh of hosts. 
3:2 But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: 
3:3 and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they will offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness. 
3:4 Then will the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. 
3:5 And I will come near to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those who unjustly reduce the wages of the hired worker, the widow, and the fatherless, and who turn aside the sojourner [from his right], and do not fear me, says Yahweh of hosts. 
3:6 For I, Yahweh, do not change; therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.
3:7 From the days of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have turned aside from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, says Yahweh of hosts. But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, In what shall we return? 
3:8 Will man rob God? Yet you<sup><small>+</small></sup> rob me. But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, In what have we robbed you? In tithes and offerings. 
3:9 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are cursed with the curse; for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> rob me, even this whole nation. 
3:10 Bring<sup><small>+</small></sup> the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, says Yahweh of hosts, if I will not open for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the windows of heaven, and pour out a blessing for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that there will not be room enough [to receive it]. 
3:11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sakes, and he will not destroy the fruits of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> ground; neither will your<sup><small>+</small></sup> vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, says Yahweh of hosts. 
3:12 And all nations will call you<sup><small>+</small></sup> happy; for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be a delightsome land, says Yahweh of hosts.
3:13 Your<sup><small>+</small></sup> words have been stout against me, says Yahweh. Yet you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, What have we spoken against you? 
3:14 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have said, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before Yahweh of hosts? 
3:15 And now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are built up; yes, they make trial of God, and escape.
3:16 Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for those who feared Yahweh, and who thought on his name. 
3:17 And they will be mine, says Yahweh of hosts, [even] my own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him. 
3:18 Then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who does not serve him.
4:1 For, look, the day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and all who work wickedness, will be stubble; and the day that comes will burn them up, says Yahweh of hosts, that it will leave them neither root nor branch. 
4:2 But to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who fear my name the sun of righteousness will arise with healing in its wings; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will go forth, and leap as calves of the stall. 
4:3 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes under the soles of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> feet in the day that I make, says Yahweh of hosts.
4:4 Remember<sup><small>+</small></sup> the law of Moses my slave, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances. 
4:5 Look, I will send you<sup><small>+</small></sup> Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of Yahweh comes. 
4:6 And he will turn the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to their fathers; or else I will come and strike the earth with a curse.
