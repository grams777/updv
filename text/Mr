1:1 The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 
1:2 Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Look, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way; 
1:3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make<sup><small>+</small></sup> ready the way of Yahweh, Make his paths straight; 
1:4 John the Baptist came in the wilderness and was preaching a baptism of repentance to remission of sins. 
1:5 And all the country of Judea, and all those of Jerusalem went out to him; and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. 
1:6 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and [had] a leather loincloth about his loins, and ate locusts and wild honey. 
1:7 And he preached, saying, There comes after me he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 
1:8 I baptized you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in water; but he will baptize you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the Holy Spirit.
1:9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan. 
1:10 And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent apart, and the Spirit as a dove descending on him: 
1:11 and a voice came out of the heavens, You are my beloved Son, in you I am well pleased.
1:12 And right away the Spirit drives him forth into the wilderness. 
1:13 And he was in the wilderness forty days tried by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels were serving him.
1:14 Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the good news of God, 
1:15 and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and believe<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the good news.
1:16 And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers. 
1:17 And Jesus said to them, Come<sup><small>+</small></sup> after me, and I will make you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to become fishers of men. 
1:18 And immediately they left the nets, and followed him. 
1:19 And going on a little further, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat preparing the nets. 
1:20 And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers, and went after him.
1:21 And they go into Capernaum; and right away on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. 
1:22 And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
1:23 And right away there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 
1:24 saying, What do we have to do with you, Jesus you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God. 
1:25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him. 
1:26 And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. 
1:27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him. 
1:28 And the report of him went out right away everywhere into all the region around Galilee.
1:29 And right away, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
1:30 Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever; and right away they tell him of her: 
1:31 and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she served them.
1:32 And at evening, when the sun set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed with demons. 
1:33 And all the city was gathered together at the door. 
1:34 And he healed many who were sick with diverse diseases, and cast out many demons; and he didn't allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.
1:35 And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed. 
1:36 And Simon and those who were with him followed after him; 
1:37 and they found him, and say to him, All are seeking you. 
1:38 And he says to them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end I came forth. 
1:39 And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
1:40 And there comes to him a leper, imploring him, and kneeling down, and saying to him, If you will, you can make me clean. 
1:41 And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and says to him, I will; be made clean. 
1:42 And immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. 
1:43 And he strictly charged him, and immediately sent him out, 
1:44 and says to him, See [that] you say nothing to any man: but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. 
1:45 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
2:1 And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was at home. 
2:2 And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room [for them], no, not even about the door: and he spoke the word to them.
2:3 And they come, bringing to him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four. 
2:4 And not being able to bring [the man] to him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed on which the sick of the palsy lay. 
2:5 And Jesus seeing their faith says to the sick of the palsy, Child, your sins are forgiven. 
2:6 But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, 
2:7 Why does this man thus speak? He blasphemes. Who can forgive sins but one, God? 
2:8 And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned to themselves, says to them, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> reason these things in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts? 
2:9 Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up your bed, and walk? 
2:10 But that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins--he says to the sick of the palsy: 
2:11 I say to you, Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house. 
2:12 And he arose, and immediately took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
2:13 And he went forth again by the seaside; and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them. 
2:14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the place of toll, and he says to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him. 
2:15 And it comes to pass, that he was sitting at meat in his house, and many publicans and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him. 
2:16 And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans, said to his disciples, [How is it] that he eats with publicans and sinners? 
2:17 And when Jesus heard it, he says to them, Those who are whole have no need of a physician, but those who are sick: I didn't come to call the righteous, but sinners.
2:18 And John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say to him, Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast? 
2:19 And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can't fast. 
2:20 But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. 
2:21 No man sews a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment: else that which should fill it up takes from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made. 
2:22 And no man puts new wine into old wineskins; else the wine will burst the skins, and the wine perishes, and the skins: but [they put] new wine into fresh wineskins.
2:23 And it came to pass, that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears. 
2:24 And the Pharisees said to him, Look, why do they do on the Sabbath day that which is not lawful? 
2:25 And he says to them, Did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and those who were with him? 
2:26 How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him? 
2:27 And he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath: 
2:28 so that the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
3:1 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had his hand withered. 
3:2 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day; that they might accuse him. 
3:3 And he says to the man who had his hand withered, Stand in the middle [of the synagogue]. 
3:4 And he says to them, Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a soul, or to kill? But they held their peace. 
3:5 And when he had looked around on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch forth [your] hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored. 
3:6 And the Pharisees went out, and right away with the Herodians gave counsel against him, how they might destroy him.
3:7 And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judea, 
3:8 and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him. 
3:9 And he spoke to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him: 
3:10 for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed on him that they might touch him. 
3:11 And the unclean spirits, whenever they looked at him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, You are the Son of God. 
3:12 And he charged them much that they should not make him known.
3:13 And he goes up into the mountain, and calls to him whom he himself wanted; and they went to him. 
3:14 And he appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, 
3:15 and to have authority to cast out demons. 
3:16 And he appointed the twelve: and he gave the name Peter to Simon; 
3:17 and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he gave them the name Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder: 
3:18 and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean, 
3:19 and Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up.
3:20 And he comes into a house. And the multitude comes together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 
3:21 And when his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself. 
3:22 And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebul, and, By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons. 
3:23 And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? 
3:24 And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom can't stand. 
3:25 And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. 
3:26 And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can't stand, but has an end. 
3:27 But no one can enter into the house of the strong [man], and spoil his goods, except he first binds the strong [man]; and then he will spoil his house. 
3:28 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, All their sins will be forgiven to the sons of men, and their blasphemies by whichever they will blaspheme: 
3:29 but whoever will blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin: 
3:30 because they said, He has an unclean spirit.
3:31 And his mother and his brothers come; and, standing outside, they sent to him, calling him. 
3:32 And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say to him, Look, your mother and your brothers and your sisters outside seek for you. 
3:33 And he answers them, and says, Who is my mother and my brothers? 
3:34 And looking around on those who sat around him, he says, Here are my mother and my brothers. 
3:35 For whoever will do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
4:1 And again he began to teach by the seaside. And there is gathered to him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.
4:2 And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching, 
4:3 Listen: Look, the sower went forth to sow: 
4:4 and it came to pass, as he sowed, some [seed] fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured it. 
4:5 And other [seed] fell on the rocky [ground], where it did not have much earth; and right away it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth: 
4:6 and when the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 
4:7 And other [seed] fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. 
4:8 And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold. 
4:9 And he said, Who has ears to hear, let him hear.
4:10 And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables. 
4:11 And he said to them, To you<sup><small>+</small></sup> is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables: 
4:12 that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.
4:13 And he says to them, Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not know this parable? And how will you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know all the parables? 
4:14 The sower sows the word. 
4:15 And these are those by the wayside, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, right away Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them. 
4:16 And these are those who are sown on the rocky [places], who, when they have heard the word, right away receive it with joy; 
4:17 and they have no root in themselves, but endure for awhile; then, when tribulation or persecution rises because of the word, right away they stumble. 
4:18 And others are those who are sown among the thorns; these are those who have heard the word, 
4:19 and the cares of the age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. 
4:20 And those are the ones who were sown on the good ground: such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.
4:21 And he said to them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, [and] not to be put on the lampstand? 
4:22 For there is nothing hid, except that it should be manifested; neither was [anything] made secret, but that it should come to light. 
4:23 If any man has ears to hear, let him hear. 
4:24 And he said to them, Take heed what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hear: with what measure you<sup><small>+</small></sup> mete it will be measured to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; and more will be given to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
4:25 For he who has, to him will be given: and he who has not, from him will be taken away even that which he has.
4:26 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth; 
4:27 and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn't know how. 
4:28 The earth bears fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. 
4:29 But when the fruit is [ready to] deliver, right away he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come. 
4:30 And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or in what parable shall we set it forth? 
4:31 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown on the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth, 
4:32 yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under its shadow.
4:33 And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it; 
4:34 and without a parable he did not speak to them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.
4:35 And on that day, when evening came, he says to them, Let us go over to the other side. 
4:36 And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him. 
4:37 And there rises a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling. 
4:38 And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they wake him, and say to him, Teacher, don't you care that we perish? 
4:39 And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 
4:40 And he said to them, Why are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> fearful? Have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not yet faith? 
4:41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
5:1 And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes. 
5:2 And when he came out of the boat, right away there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 
5:3 who had his dwelling in the tombs: and no man could anymore bind him, no, not with a chain; 
5:4 because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been rent apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and no man had strength to tame him. 
5:5 And always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones. 
5:6 And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped him; 
5:7 and crying out with a loud voice, he says, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don't torment me. 
5:8 For he said to him, Come forth, you unclean spirit, out of the man. 
5:9 And he asked him, What is your name? And he says to him, My name is Legion; for we are many. 
5:10 And he implored him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
5:11 Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine being shepherded. 
5:12 And they implored him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 
5:13 And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, [in number] about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea. 
5:14 And those who shepherded them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass. 
5:15 And they come to Jesus, and look at him who was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, [even] him who had the legion: and they were afraid. 
5:16 And those who saw it declared to them how it befell him who was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine. 
5:17 And they began to urge him to depart from their borders.
5:18 And as he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed with demons implored him that he might be with him. 
5:19 And he did not allow him, but says to him, Go to your house to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and [how] he had mercy on you. 
5:20 And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him: and all men marveled. 
5:21 And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.
5:22 And there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he falls at his feet, 
5:23 and implores him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: [I pray you], that you come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live. 
5:24 And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.
5:25 And a woman, who had a discharge of blood twelve years, 
5:26 and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and had not been getting better, but rather grew worse, 
5:27 having heard about Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment. 
5:28 For she said, If I touch but his garments, I will be made whole. 
5:29 And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague. 
5:30 And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power [proceeding] from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments? 
5:31 And his disciples said to him, You see the multitude thronging you, and you say, Who touched me? 
5:32 And he looked around to see her who had done this thing. 
5:33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 
5:34 And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace, and be whole of your plague.
5:35 While he yet spoke, they come from the ruler of the synagogue's [house], saying, Your daughter is dead: why do you trouble the Teacher any further? 
5:36 But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, Don't be afraid, only believe. 
5:37 And he allowed no man to follow with him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. 
5:38 And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he sees a tumult, and [many] weeping and wailing greatly. 
5:39 And when he had entered in, he says to them, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> make a tumult, and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeps. 
5:40 And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all forth, takes the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him, and goes in where the child was. 
5:41 And taking the child by the hand, he says to her, Talitha koum; which is, being interpreted, Girl, I say to you, Arise. 
5:42 And immediately the girl rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed immediately with a great amazement. 
5:43 And he charged them much that no man should know this: and he commanded that [something] should be given her to eat.
6:1 And he went out from there; and he comes into his own country; and his disciples follow him. 
6:2 And when the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From where has this man these things? And, What [is] the wisdom that is given to this man, and [what is the meaning of] such mighty works being done by his hands? 
6:3 Isn't this the son of the carpenter and Mary, and the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him. 
6:4 And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. 
6:5 And he could there do no mighty work, except that he laid his hands on a few sick folk, and healed them. 
6:6 And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went around the surrounding villages teaching.
6:7 And he calls to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits; 
6:8 and he charged them that they should take nothing for [their] journey, except a staff only; no bread, no bag, no money in their belt; 
6:9 but [he said], fasten on sandals and don't put on two coats. 
6:10 And he said to them, Wherever you<sup><small>+</small></sup> enter into a house, stay there until you<sup><small>+</small></sup> depart from there. 
6:11 And whatever place will not receive you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and they do not hear you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go forth from there, shake off the dust that is under your<sup><small>+</small></sup> feet for a testimony to them. 
6:12 And they went out, and preached that [men] should repent. 
6:13 And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them.
6:14 And King Herod heard [of it], for his name had become known. And they said, John the Baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him. 
6:15 But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, [It is] a prophet, [even] as one of the prophets. 
6:16 But Herod, when he heard [of it], said, John, whom I beheaded, he is risen. 
6:17 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold on John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; for he had married her. 
6:18 For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife. 
6:19 And Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not; 
6:20 for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was much perplexed; and he heard him gladly.
6:21 And when a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, and the generals, and the chief men of Galilee; 
6:22 and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those who sat to eat with him; the king said to the girl, Ask of me whatever you will, and I will give it to you. 
6:23 And he emphatically swore to her, Whatever you will ask of me, I will give it you, to the half of my kingdom. 
6:24 And she went out, and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. 
6:25 And she came in right away in a hurry to the king, and asked, saying, I want that you forthwith give me on a platter the head of John the Baptist. 
6:26 And the king was exceedingly sorry; but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat to eat, he would not reject her. 
6:27 And right away the king sent forth a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 
6:28 and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. 
6:29 And when his disciples heard [of it], they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
6:30 And the apostles gather themselves together to Jesus; and they told him all things that they had done, and that they had taught. 
6:31 And he says to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> come yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. 
6:32 And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart. 
6:33 And [the people] saw them going, and many knew [them], and they ran together there on foot from all the cities, and outwent them.
6:34 And he came forth and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things. 
6:35 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, and said, The place is desert, and the day is now far spent; 
6:36 send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves something to eat. 
6:37 But he answered and said to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> give them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy 200 denarii worth of bread, and give them to eat? 
6:38 And he says to them, How many loaves do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have? Go [and] see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fish. 
6:39 And he commanded them that all should sit down by companies on the green grass. 
6:40 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. 
6:41 And he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves; and he gave to his disciples to set before them; and the two fish he divided among them all. 
6:42 And they all ate, and were filled. 
6:43 And they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fish. 
6:44 And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men. 
6:45 And right away he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before [him] to the other side to Bethsaida, while he himself sends the multitude away. 
6:46 And after he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray.
6:47 And when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he alone on the land. 
6:48 And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them: 
6:49 but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out; 
6:50 for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and says to them, Be of good cheer: it is I; don't be afraid. 
6:51 And he went up to them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were very amazed in themselves beyond measure; 
6:52 for they didn't understand concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened.
6:53 And when they had crossed over, they came to the land to Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. 
6:54 And when they had come out of the boat, immediately [the people] knew him, 
6:55 and ran around that whole region, and began to carry about on their beds those who were sick, where they heard he was. 
6:56 And wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and implored him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
7:1 And there are gathered together to him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem, 
7:2 and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with common hands, that is unwashed. 
7:3 --For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, don't eat, holding the tradition of the elders; 
7:4 and [when they come] from the marketplace, except they bathe themselves, they don't eat; and many other things there are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and bronze vessels, and beds.-- 
7:5 And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why don't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with common hands? 
7:6 And he said to them, Isaiah prophesied well of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors me with their lips, But their heart is far from me. 
7:7 But in vain they worship me, Teaching [as their] doctrines the precepts of men. 
7:8 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men. 
7:9 And he said to them, Full well do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> reject the commandment of God, that your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tradition might be established. 
7:10 For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him die the death: 
7:11 but you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, If a man will say to his father or his mother, That with which you might have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given [to God]; 
7:12 you<sup><small>+</small></sup> no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother; 
7:13 making void the word of God by your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tradition, which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have delivered: and many such like things you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do. 
7:14 And he called to him the multitude again, and said to them, Hear me all of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and understand: 
7:15 there is nothing from outside the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man. 
7:17 And when he had entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable. 
7:18 And he says to them, Are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> so without understanding also? Don't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> perceive, that whatever from outside goes into the man, [it] can't defile him; 
7:19 because it does not go into his heart, but into his belly, and goes out into the latrine? [This he said], making all meats clean. 
7:20 And he said, That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. 
7:21 For from inside, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, 
7:22 greed, wickednesses, deceit, sexual immorality, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness: 
7:23 all these evil things proceed from inside, and defile the man.
7:24 And from there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid. 
7:25 But right away a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. 
7:26 Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she implored him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter. 
7:27 And he said to her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. 
7:28 But she answered and says to him, Lord, even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. 
7:29 And he said to her, For this saying go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter. 
7:30 And she went away to her house, and found the child laid on the bed, and the demon gone out.
7:31 And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the borders of Decapolis. 
7:32 And they bring to him one who was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they urge him to lay his hand on him. 
7:33 And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue; 
7:34 and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. 
7:35 And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain. 
7:36 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it. 
7:37 And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well; he makes even the deaf to hear, and the mute to speak.
8:1 In those days, there was again a great multitude. And [since] they had nothing to eat, he called the disciples, [and] says to them, 
8:2 I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: 
8:3 and if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from afar. 
8:4 And his disciples answered him, From where will one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place? 
8:5 And he asked them, How many loaves do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have? And they said, Seven. 
8:6 And he commands the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he broke, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude. 
8:7 And they had a few small fish: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them. 
8:8 And they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets. 
8:9 And they were about four thousand: and he sent them away. 
8:10 And right away he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
8:11 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him. 
8:12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and says, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, There will no sign be given to this generation. 
8:13 And he left them, and again entering into [the boat] departed to the other side. 
8:14 And they forgot to take bread; and they did not have in the boat with them more than one loaf.
8:15 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. 
8:16 And they discussed one with another that they have no bread. 
8:17 And Jesus perceiving it says to them, Why discuss that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have no bread? Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not yet perceive, neither understand? Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heart hardened? 
8:18 Having eyes, don't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see? And having ears, don't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hear? And don't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> remember? 
8:19 When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> take up? They say to him, Twelve. 
8:20 When [I broke] the seven among the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> take up? And they say to him, Seven. 
8:21 And he said to them, Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not yet understand?
8:22 And they come to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and urge him to touch him. 
8:23 And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him, Do you see anything? 
8:24 And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I see [them] as trees, walking. 
8:25 Then again he laid his hands on his eyes; and he looked steadfastly, and was restored, and saw all things clearly. 
8:26 And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village.
8:27 And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am? 
8:28 And they told him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets. 
8:29 And he asked them, But who do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say that I am? Peter answers and says to him, You are the Christ. 
8:30 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
8:31 And he began to teach them, that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 
8:32 And he spoke the saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. 
8:33 But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and says, Get behind me, Satan; for you do not mind the things of God, but the things of men. 
8:34 And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, If any man wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 
8:35 For whoever wants to save his soul will lose it; and whoever will lose his soul for the sake of me and the good news will save it. 
8:36 For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul? 
8:37 For what should a man give in exchange for his soul? 
8:38 For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. 
9:1 And he said to them, Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, There are some here of those who stand, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the kingdom of God come with power.
9:2 And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John, and brings them up into a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them; 
9:3 and his garments became glistering, exceedingly white, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them. 
9:4 And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. 
9:5 And Peter answers and says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. 
9:6 For he didn't know what to answer; for they became exceedingly afraid. 
9:7 And there came a cloud overshadowing them: and there came a voice out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son: hear<sup><small>+</small></sup> him. 
9:8 And suddenly looking around, they saw no one anymore, except Jesus only with themselves.
9:9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, except when the Son of Man should have risen again from the dead. 
9:10 And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean. 
9:11 And they asked him, saying, [How is it] that the scribes say that Elijah must first come? 
9:12 And he said to them, Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things: and how is it written of the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be set at nothing? 
9:13 But I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they would, even as it is written of him.
9:14 And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them. 
9:15 And right away all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him greeted him. 
9:16 And he asked them, What do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> question with them?
9:17 And one of the multitude answered him, Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit; 
9:18 and wherever it takes him, it dashes him down: and he foams, and grinds his teeth, and becomes stiff: and I spoke to your disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able. 
9:19 And he answers them and says, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? How long shall I bear with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? Bring him to me. 
9:20 And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, immediately the spirit tore him grievously; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. 
9:21 And he asked his father, How much time is it since this has come to him? And he said, From a child. 
9:22 And often it has cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us. 
9:23 And Jesus said to him, If you can! All things are possible to him who believes. 
9:24 Immediately the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help my unbelief.
9:25 And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and enter into him no more. 
9:26 And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and [the boy] became as one dead; insomuch that most said, He is dead. 
9:27 But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose. 
9:28 And when he came into the house, his disciples asked him privately, [How is it] that we could not cast it out? 
9:29 And he said to them, This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer.
9:30 And they went forth from there, and passed through Galilee; and he did not want that any man should know it. 
9:31 For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of Man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise again. 
9:32 But they didn't understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
9:33 And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were you<sup><small>+</small></sup> reasoning on the way? 
9:34 But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another on the way, who [was] the greatest. 
9:35 And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he says to them, If any man would be first, he will be last of all, and servant of all. 
9:36 And he took a little child, and set the child among them: and taking the child in his arms, he said to them, 
9:37 Whoever will receive one of such little children in my name, receives me: and whoever receives me, does not receive me, but him who sent me.
9:38 John said to him, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he didn't follow us. 
9:39 But Jesus said, Don't forbid him: for there is no man who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me. 
9:40 For he who is not against us is for us. 
9:41 For whoever will give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a cup of water to drink, because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are Christ's, truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, he will in no way lose his reward.
9:42 And whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were put around his neck, and he were cast into the sea. 
9:43 And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off: it is good for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. 
9:45 And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off: it is good for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into hell. 
9:47 And if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out: it is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell; 
9:48 where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched. 
9:49 For everyone will be salted with fire. 
9:50 Salt is good: but if the salt has lost its saltness, how will you<sup><small>+</small></sup> season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.
10:1 And he arose from there, and comes into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan: and multitudes come together to him again; and, as he was accustomed, he taught them again.
10:2 And Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to divorce [his] wife? trying him. 
10:3 And he answered and said to them, What did Moses command you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? 
10:4 And they said, Moses allowed to write a bill of divorce, and to divorce. 
10:5 But Jesus said to them, For your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hardness of heart he wrote you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this commandment. 
10:6 But from the beginning of the creation, Male and female he made them. 
10:7 For this cause will a man leave his father and mother, and will stick to his wife; 
10:8 and the two will become one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh. 
10:9 What therefore God has joined together, let man not separate. 
10:10 And in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter. 
10:11 And he says to them, Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her: 
10:12 and if she herself divorced her husband, and marries another, she commits adultery.
10:13 And they were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them: and the disciples rebuked them. 
10:14 But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said to them, Allow the little children to come to me; don't forbid them: for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 
10:15 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he will in no way enter in it. 
10:16 And he took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands on them.
10:17 And as he was going forth into the way, one ran to him, and knelt to him, and asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? 
10:18 And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? None is good but one, God. 
10:19 You know the commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother. 
10:20 And he said to him, Teacher, all these things I have observed from my youth. 
10:21 And Jesus looking on him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. 
10:22 But his countenance fell at the saying, and he went away sorrowful: for he was one who had great possessions.
10:23 And Jesus looked around, and says to his disciples, How hardly will those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
10:24 And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answers again, and says to them, Children, how hard it is to enter into the kingdom of God! 
10:25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
10:26 And they were exceedingly astonished, saying to themselves, Then who can be saved? 
10:27 Jesus looking on them says, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God. 
10:28 Peter began to say to him, Look, we have left all, and have followed you. 
10:29 Jesus said, Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, There is no man who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for the sake of me, and for the sake of the good news, 
10:30 but he [who] will receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life. 
10:31 But many [who are] first will be last; and the last first.
10:32 And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen to him, 
10:33 [saying,] Look, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles: 
10:34 and they will mock him, and will spit on him, and will scourge him, and will kill him; and after three days he will rise again.
10:35 And there come near to him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying to him, Teacher, we want that you should do for us whatever we will ask of you. 
10:36 And he said to them, What do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> want that I should do for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? 
10:37 And they said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand, and one on [your] left hand, in your glory. 
10:38 But Jesus said to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't know what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> ask. Are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> able to drink the cup that I drink? Or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? 
10:39 And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, The cup that I drink you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized with that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be baptized: 
10:40 but to sit at my right hand or at [my] left hand is not mine to give; but [it is for them] for whom it has been prepared.
10:41 And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John. 
10:42 And Jesus called them to him, and says to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> know that those who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them. 
10:43 But it is not so among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: but whoever would become great among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, will be your<sup><small>+</small></sup> servant; 
10:44 and whoever would be first among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, will be slave of all. 
10:45 For the Son of Man also did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his soul a ransom for many.
10:46 And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the wayside. 
10:47 And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me. 
10:48 And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Son of David, have mercy on me. 
10:49 And Jesus stood still, and said, Call<sup><small>+</small></sup> him. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calls you. 
10:50 And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus. 
10:51 And Jesus answered him, and said, What do you want that I should do to you? And the blind man said to him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight. 
10:52 And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him in the way.
11:1 And when they draw near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sends two of his disciples, 
11:2 and says to them, Go your<sup><small>+</small></sup> way into the village that is across from you<sup><small>+</small></sup>: and right away as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> enter into it, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will find a colt tied, on which no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him. 
11:3 And if anyone says to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do this? say<sup><small>+</small></sup>, The Lord has need of him; and right away he will send him back here. 
11:4 And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door outside in the open street; and they loose him. 
11:5 And certain of those who stood there said to them, What do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do, loosing the colt? 
11:6 And they said to them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go. 
11:7 And they bring the colt to Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat on him. 
11:8 And many spread their garments on the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields. 
11:9 And those who went before, and those who followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed [is] he who comes in the name of Yahweh: 
11:10 Blessed [is] the kingdom that comes, [the kingdom] of our father David: Hosanna in the highest. 
11:11 And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked around on all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
11:12 And on the next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry. 
11:13 And seeing a fig tree far off having leaves, he came, if perhaps he might find anything on it: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it wasn't the season of figs. 
11:14 And he answered and said to it, No man eat fruit from you from now on forever. And his disciples heard it.
11:15 And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves; 
11:16 and he would not allow that any man should carry a vessel through the temple. 
11:17 And he taught, and said to them, Is it not written, My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have made it a den of robbers. 
11:18 And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. 
11:19 And when evening came they went forth out of the city.
11:20 And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. 
11:21 And Peter calling to remembrance says to him, Rabbi, look, the fig tree which you cursed is withered away. 
11:22 And Jesus answering says to them, Have faith in God. 
11:23 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Whoever will say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea; and will not doubt in his heart, but will believe that what he says comes to pass; he will have it. 
11:24 Therefore I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, All things that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> pray and ask for, believe that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> receive them, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will have them.
11:25 And whenever you<sup><small>+</small></sup> stand praying, forgive, if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have anything against anyone; that your<sup><small>+</small></sup> Father also who is in heaven may forgive you<sup><small>+</small></sup> your<sup><small>+</small></sup> trespasses.
11:27 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders; 
11:28 and they said to him, By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things? 
11:29 And Jesus said to them, I will ask of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> one question, and answer me, and I will tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup> by what authority I do these things. 
11:30 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me. 
11:31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we will say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not believe him? 
11:32 But should we say, From men--they feared the multitude: for all truly held John to be a prophet. 
11:33 And they answered Jesus and say, We don't know. And Jesus says to them, Neither do I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup> by what authority I do these things.
12:1 And he began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug a pit for the wine press, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country. 
12:2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a slave, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard. 
12:3 And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty. 
12:4 And again he sent to them another slave; and him they wounded in the head, and handled shamefully. 
12:5 And he sent another; and him they killed: and many others; beating some, and killing some. 
12:6 He had yet one, a beloved son: he sent him last to them, saying, They will reverence my son. 
12:7 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours. 
12:8 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard. 
12:9 What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. 
12:10 Have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not read even this Scripture: The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; 
12:11 This was from Yahweh, And it is marvelous in our eyes? 
12:12 And they sought to lay hold on him; and they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them: and they left him, and went away.
12:13 And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in talk. 
12:14 And when they had come, they say to him, Teacher, we know that you are true, and do not care about [what] anyone [thinks]; for you do not regard the person of men, but of a truth teach the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? Shall we give, or shall we not give? 
12:15 But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> make trial of me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it. 
12:16 And they brought it. And he says to them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said to him, Caesar's. 
12:17 And Jesus said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marveled greatly at him.
12:18 And there come to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, 
12:19 Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother. 
12:20 There were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed; 
12:21 and the second took her, and died, leaving no seed behind him; and the third likewise: 
12:22 and the seven left no seed. Last of all the woman also died. 
12:23 In the resurrection, when they will rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as wife. 
12:24 Jesus said to them, Is it not for this cause that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> err, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't know the Scriptures, nor the power of God? 
12:25 For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in heaven. 
12:26 But as concerning the dead, that they are raised; have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not read in the Book of Moses, in [the place concerning] the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? 
12:27 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do greatly err.
12:28 And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and having seeing that he answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all? 
12:29 Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O Israel; Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one: 
12:30 and you will love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength. 
12:31 The second is this, You will love your fellow man as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. 
12:32 And the scribe said to him, Of a truth, Teacher, you have well said that he is one; and there is no other but he: 
12:33 and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his fellow man as himself, is much more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices. 
12:34 And when Jesus saw that he answered with understanding, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dared ask him any question.
12:35 And Jesus answered and said, as he taught in the temple, How do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? 
12:36 David himself said in the Holy Spirit, Yahweh said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, Until I set your enemies under your feet. 
12:37 David himself calls him Lord; and how is he his son? And the large crowd heard him gladly. 
12:38 And in his teaching he said, Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and [to have] salutations in the marketplaces, 
12:39 and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts: 
12:40 those who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation.
12:41 And he sat down opposite the treasury, and watched how the multitude cast money into the treasury: and many who were rich cast in much. 
12:42 And there came a poor widow, and she cast in two lepta, which make a quadrans. 
12:43 And he called to him his disciples, and said to them, Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, This poor widow cast in more than all those who are casting into the treasury: 
12:44 for they all cast in of their superfluity; but she of her want cast in all that she had, [even] all her living.
13:1 And as he went forth out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him, Teacher, look, what manner of stones and what manner of buildings! 
13:2 And Jesus said to him, Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down.
13:3 And as he sat on the mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, 
13:4 Tell us, when will these things be? And what [will be] the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished? 
13:5 And Jesus began to say to them, Take heed that no man leads you<sup><small>+</small></sup> astray. 
13:6 Many will come in my name, saying, I am [he]; and will lead many astray. 
13:7 And when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be troubled: [these things] must surely come to pass; but the end is not yet. 
13:8 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in diverse places; there will be famines: these things are the beginning of travail.
13:9 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> take heed to yourselves. They will deliver you<sup><small>+</small></sup> up to Sanhedrins; and in synagogues you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be beaten; and before governors and kings you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will stand for my sake, for a testimony to them. 
13:10 And the good news must first be preached to all the nations. 
13:11 And when they lead you<sup><small>+</small></sup> [to judgment], and deliver you<sup><small>+</small></sup> up, don't be anxious beforehand what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will speak: but whatever will be given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in that hour, that speak<sup><small>+</small></sup>; for it is not you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who speak, but the Holy Spirit. 
13:12 And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death. 
13:13 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.
13:14 But when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see the detestable thing of desolation standing where it ought not (let him who reads understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains: 
13:15 and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house: 
13:16 and let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak. 
13:17 But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse in those days! 
13:18 And pray<sup><small>+</small></sup> that it is not in the winter. 
13:19 For those days will be tribulation, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be. 
13:20 And except Yahweh had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the elect's sake, whom he chose, he shortened the days. 
13:21 And then if any man will say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Look, here is the Christ; or, Look, there; don't believe [it]: 
13:22 for there will arise false Christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, the elect. 
13:23 But take<sup><small>+</small></sup> heed: I have told you<sup><small>+</small></sup> all things beforehand.
13:24 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, 
13:25 and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. 
13:26 And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. 
13:27 And then he will send forth the angels, and will gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
13:28 Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know that the summer is near; 
13:29 even so you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see these things coming to pass, know<sup><small>+</small></sup> that it is near, [even] at the doors. 
13:30 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, This generation will not pass away, until all these things be accomplished. 
13:31 Heaven and earth will pass away: but my words will definitely not pass away.
13:32 But of that day or that hour knows no one, not even the angels in heaven nor even the Son, but the Father. 
13:33 Take<sup><small>+</small></sup> heed, watch<sup><small>+</small></sup>: for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't know when the time is. 
13:34 [It is] as [when] a man, sojourning in another country, having left his house, and given authority to his slaves, to each one his work, commanded also the porter to watch. 
13:35 Watch therefore: for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't know when the lord of the house comes, whether at evening, or at midnight, or at rooster crowing, or in the morning; 
13:36 lest coming suddenly he find you<sup><small>+</small></sup> sleeping. 
13:37 And what I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> I say to all, Watch.
14:1 Now after two days it was going to be [the feast of] the Passover and the unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him with subtlety, and kill him: 
14:2 for they said, Not during the feast, lest perhaps there will be a tumult of the people.
14:3 And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat to eat, there came a woman having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure nard very costly; [and] she broke the cruse, and poured it over his head. 
14:4 But there were some who had indignation among themselves, [saying,] To what purpose has this waste of the ointment been made? 
14:5 For this ointment might have been sold for over 300 denarii, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her. 
14:6 But Jesus said, Leave her alone; why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> trouble her? She has worked a good work on me. 
14:7 For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> always have the poor with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and whenever you<sup><small>+</small></sup> want you<sup><small>+</small></sup> can do them good: but me you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not always have. 
14:8 She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for the burying. 
14:9 And truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Wherever the good news will be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her. 
14:10 And Judas Iscariot, he who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them. 
14:11 And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him [to them].
14:12 And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples say to him, Where do you want us to go and make ready that you may eat the Passover? 
14:13 And he sends two of his disciples, and says to them, Go into the city, and there will meet you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him; 
14:14 and wherever he will enter in, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is my guest-chamber, where I will eat the Passover with my disciples? 
14:15 And he will himself show you<sup><small>+</small></sup> a large upper room furnished [and] ready: and there make ready for us. 
14:16 And the disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the Passover. 
14:17 And when it was evening he comes with the twelve.
14:18 And as they sat and were eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, One of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will deliver me up, [even] he who eats with me. 
14:19 They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, Is it I? 
14:20 And he said to them, [It is] one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish. 
14:21 For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him: but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up! [It would have been] good for that man if he had not been born. 
14:22 And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, Take<sup><small>+</small></sup>: this is my body. 
14:23 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them: and they all drank of it. 
14:24 And he said to them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. 
14:25 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. 
14:26 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives. 
14:27 And Jesus says to them, All you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be offended: for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered abroad. 
14:29 But Peter said to him, Although all will be offended, yet I will not. 
14:30 And Jesus says to him, Truly I say to you, that you today, [even] this night, before the rooster crows twice, will deny me thrice. 
14:31 But he spoke vehemently, If I must die with you, I will definitely not deny you. And in like manner also they all said.
14:32 And they come to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he says to his disciples, Sit<sup><small>+</small></sup> here, while I pray. 
14:33 And he takes with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and very troubled. 
14:34 And he says to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful even to death: stay<sup><small>+</small></sup> here, and watch<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
14:35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him. 
14:36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; remove this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what you will. 
14:37 And he comes, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Simon, do you sleep? Couldn't you watch one hour? 
14:38 Watch and pray, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't enter into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 
14:39 And again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words. 
14:40 And again he came, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they didn't know what to answer him. 
14:41 And he comes the third time, and says to them, Are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> still sleeping and resting? It is enough; the hour has come; look, the Son of Man is delivered up into the hands of sinners. 
14:42 Arise, let us be going: look, he who delivers me up is at hand.
14:43 And immediately, while he yet spoke, comes Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. 
14:44 Now he that delivered him up had given them a token, saying, Whomever I will kiss, that is he; take him, and lead him away safely. 
14:45 And when he came, immediately he came to him, and says, Rabbi; and kissed him. 
14:46 And they laid hands on him, and took him. 
14:47 But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and took off his ear. 
14:48 And Jesus answered and said to them, Have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to seize me? 
14:49 I was daily with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the temple teaching, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> didn't take me: but [this is done] that the Scriptures might be fulfilled. 
14:50 And they all left him, and fled. 
14:51 And a certain young man followed with him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over [his] naked [body]: and they lay hold on him; 
14:52 but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked.
14:53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and there come together all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. 
14:54 And Peter had followed him far off, even inside, into the court of the high priest; and he was sitting with the attendants, and warming himself in the light [of the fire]. 
14:55 Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin sought witness against Jesus to put him to death; and did not find it. 
14:56 For many bore false witness against him, and their witness didn't agree together. 
14:57 And there stood up some, and bore false witness against him, saying, 
14:58 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands. 
14:59 And even so their witness did not agree together. 
14:60 And the high priest stood up in the middle [of the Sanhedrin], and asked Jesus, saying, Do you answer nothing? What is it which these witness against you? 
14:61 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and says to him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? 
14:62 And Jesus said, I am: and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. 
14:63 And the high priest rent his clothes, and says, What further need do we have of witnesses? 
14:64 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> have heard the blasphemy: what do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> think? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death. 
14:65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the attendants received him with blows of their hands.
14:66 And as Peter was beneath in the court, there comes one of the female slaves of the high priest; 
14:67 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked on him, and says, You also were with the Nazarene, [even] Jesus. 
14:68 But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand what you say: and he went out into the porch; and the rooster crowed. 
14:69 And the slave saw him, and she began again to say to those who stood by, This is [one] of them. 
14:70 But he again denied it. And after a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, Of a truth you are [one] of them; for you are a Galilean. 
14:71 But he began to curse, and to swear, I don't know this man of whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> speak. 
14:72 And right away the second time the rooster crowed. And Peter called to mind the word, how that Jesus said to him, Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me thrice. And when he thought on it, he wept.
15:1 And right away in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. 
15:2 And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And answering he says to him, You say. 
15:3 And the chief priests accused him of many things. 
15:4 And Pilate again asked him, saying, Do you answer nothing? Look how many things they accuse you of. 
15:5 But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marveled.
15:6 Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him. 
15:7 And there was one called Barabbas, [lying] bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder. 
15:8 And the multitude went up and began to ask him [to do] as he usually did for them. 
15:9 And Pilate answered them, saying, Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> want that I release to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> the King of the Jews? 
15:10 For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. 
15:11 But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas to them. 
15:12 And Pilate again answered and said to them, Then what do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> want me to do [with him] whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> call the King of the Jews? 
15:13 And they cried out again, Crucify him. 
15:14 And Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him. 
15:15 And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
15:16 And the soldiers led him away inside the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole battalion. 
15:17 And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him; 
15:18 and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 
15:19 And they struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees worshiped him. 
15:20 And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him. 
15:21 And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go [with them], that he might bear his cross. 
15:22 And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. 
15:23 And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he did not receive it. 
15:24 And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take. 
15:25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. 
15:26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
15:27 And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right and one on his left. 
15:29 And those who passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! You who destroys the temple, and builds it in three days, 
15:30 save yourself, and come down from the cross. 
15:31 In like manner also the chief priests mocking [him] among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he can't save. 
15:32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And those who were crucified with him reproached him.
15:33 And when the sixth hour came, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 
15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? 
15:35 And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Look, he calls Elijah. 
15:36 And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let [him] be; let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down. 
15:37 And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and breathed his last. 
15:38 And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom. 
15:39 And when the captain, who stood by across from him, saw that he so breathed his last, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. 
15:40 And there were also women watching from far: among whom [were] both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; 
15:41 who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and were serving him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
15:42 And when evening was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 
15:43 there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councilor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. 
15:44 And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling to him the captain, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. 
15:45 And when he learned it of the captain, he granted the corpse to Joseph. 
15:46 And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. 
15:47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the [mother] of Joses looked at where he was laid.
16:1 And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him. 
16:2 And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen. 
16:3 And they were saying among themselves, Who will roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb? 
16:4 And looking up, they see that the stone has been rolled back: for it was exceedingly great. 
16:5 And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed. 
16:6 And he says to them, Don't be amazed: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: look, the place where they laid him! 
16:8 And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them. And they said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.
