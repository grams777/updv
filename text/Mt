1:1 The Book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.
1:2 Abraham begot Isaac; and Isaac begot Jacob; and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers;
1:3 and Judah begot Perez and Zerah from Tamar; and Perez begot Hezron; and Hezron begot Ram;
1:4 and Ram begot Amminadab; and Amminadab begot Nahshon; and Nahshon begot Salmon;
1:5 and Salmon begot Boaz from Rahab; and Boaz begot Obed from Ruth; and Obed begot Jesse;
1:6 and Jesse begot David the king. And David begot Solomon from the wife of Uriah;
1:7 and Solomon begot Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begot Abijah; and Abijah begot Asaph;
1:8 and Asaph begot Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begot Joram; and Joram begot Uzziah;
1:9 and Uzziah begot Jotham; and Jotham begot Ahaz; and Ahaz begot Hezekiah;
1:10 and Hezekiah begot Manasseh; and Manasseh begot Amos; and Amos begot Josiah;
1:11 and Josiah begot Jehoiachin and his brothers at the Babylonian Exile.
1:12 And after the Babylonian Exile, Jehoiachin begot Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel;
1:13 and Zerubbabel begot Abiud; and Abiud begot Eliakim; and Eliakim begot Azor;
1:14 and Azor begot Zadok; and Zadok begot Achim; and Achim begot Eliud;
1:15 and Eliud begot Eleazar; and Eleazar begot Matthan; and Matthan begot Jacob;
1:16 and Jacob begot Joseph; and Joseph begot Jesus, who is called Christ, from Mary.
1:17 So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian Exile were fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian Exile to the Christ were fourteen generations.
2:1 Now it came to pass in the days of Herod, King of Judea, in the highpriesthood of Caiaphas, there came a certain man named John baptizing a baptism of repentance 
2:2 who was known as being from the kindred of Aaron the priest, son of Zacharias and Elizabeth. 
2:3 And John had a garment of camel's hair, and a leather loincloth about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey. 
2:4 Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him; 
2:5 and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
2:6 And he said, I indeed baptize you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in water to repentance: but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to bear: he will baptize you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the Holy Spirit and [in] fire: 
2:7 whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor; and he will gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.
2:8 Then Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized of him. 
2:9 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately from the water: and look, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him; 
2:10 and look, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
3:1 Then Jesus was led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tried by the devil. 
3:2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward was hungry. 
3:3 And the tempter came and said to him, If you are the Son of God, say that these stones may become bread. 
3:4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man will not live by bread alone. 
3:5 Then the devil takes him into the holy city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple, 
3:6 and says to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down: for it is written, He will give his angels charge concerning you: and, On their hands they will bear you up, Lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone. 
3:7 Jesus said to him, Again it is written, You will not make trial of Yahweh your God. 
3:8 Again, the devil takes him to an exceedingly high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 
3:9 and he said to him, All these things I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me. 
3:10 Then Jesus says to him, Go, Satan: for it is written, You will worship Yahweh your God, and you will serve only him. 
3:11 Then the devil leaves him; and look, angels came and were serving him.
3:12 Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee. 
3:13 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. 
3:14 For John said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her. 
3:15 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
4:1 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent<sup><small>+</small></sup>; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
4:2 And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers. 
4:3 And he says to them, Come<sup><small>+</small></sup> after me, and I will make you<sup><small>+</small></sup> fishers of men. And they immediately left the nets, and followed him. 
4:4 And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, preparing their nets; and he called them. 
4:5 And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.
4:6 And they go into Capernaum; and right away on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. 
4:7 And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as [one] having authority, and not as their scribes. 
4:8 And right away there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 
4:9 saying, What do we have to do with you, Jesus you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God. 
4:10 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him. 
4:11 And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. 
4:12 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him. 
4:13 And the report of him went out right away everywhere into all the region around Galilee.
4:14 And when Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever. 
4:15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and served him. 
4:16 And when evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits and healed all who were sick.
4:17 And there came to him a leper. And he fell on his face, and implored him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean. 
4:18 And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be made clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 
4:19 And Jesus says to him, See you tell no man; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
4:20 And they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick of the palsy, Child, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven. 
4:21 And look, certain of the scribes said to themselves, This man blasphemes. 
4:22 And Jesus seeing their thoughts said, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> think evil in your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts? 
4:23 For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk? 
4:24 But that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins--then he says to the sick of the palsy, Arise, and take up your bed, and go to your house. 
4:25 And he arose, and departed to his house. 
4:26 But when the multitudes saw it, they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
4:27 And as Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting at the place of toll: and he says to him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. 
4:28 And it came to pass, as he sat to eat in the house, look, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples. 
4:29 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why does your<sup><small>+</small></sup> Teacher eat with the publicans and sinners? 
4:30 But when he heard it, he said, Those who are whole have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I didn't come to call the righteous, but sinners. 
4:31 Then the disciples of John come to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast? 
4:32 And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast. 
4:33 And no man puts a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment; for that which should fill it up takes from the garment, and a worse tear is made. 
4:34 Neither do [men] put new wine into old wineskins: else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins perish: but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.
5:1 At that season Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat. 
5:2 But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, Look, your disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath. 
5:3 But he said to them, Have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him; 
5:4 how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests? 
5:5 And he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath: 
5:6 so that the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
5:7 And he departed from there, and went into their synagogue: 
5:8 and look, a man having a withered hand. And they watched him to see if he would heal on the Sabbath day; so that they might accuse him. 
5:9 And he said to them, Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill? 
5:10 But they held their peace. 
5:11 Then he says to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other. 
5:12 But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.
5:13 And Jesus withdrew from there: and great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and [from] beyond the Jordan followed him. 
5:14 And the report of him went forth into all Syria: and they brought to him all who were sick, held with diverse diseases and torments, and possessed with demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he healed them.
6:1 And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God. 
6:2 And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve: 
6:3 Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip, and Bartholomew; 
6:4 Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up.
6:5 And he came down with them, and stood on a level place with a great multitude of his disciples and the people who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said,
6:6 Blessed [are] you<sup><small>+</small></sup> poor: for yours<sup><small>+</small></sup> is the kingdom of God.
6:7 Blessed [are] you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who hunger now: for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be filled.
6:8 Blessed [are] you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who weep now: for you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will laugh.
6:9 Blessed are you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, when men will hate you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and when they will separate you<sup><small>+</small></sup> [from their company], and reproach you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and cast out your<sup><small>+</small></sup> name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake.
6:10 Rejoice in that day, and leap [for joy]: for look, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner their fathers did to the prophets.
6:11 But woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who are rich! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have received your<sup><small>+</small></sup> consolation.
6:12 Woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who are full now! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will hunger.
6:13 Woe [to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>], you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who laugh now! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will mourn and weep.
6:14 Woe [to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>], when all men will speak well of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>! For in the same manner their fathers did to the false prophets.
6:15 But I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who hear,
6:16 Love your<sup><small>+</small></sup> enemies, do good to those who hate you<sup><small>+</small></sup>,
6:17 bless those who curse you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, pray for those who despitefully use you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
6:18 To him who strikes you on the [one] cheek offer also the other;
6:19 and from him who takes away your cloak don't withhold your coat also.
6:20 Give to everyone who asks you; and of him who takes away your goods don't ask [for them] back.
6:21 And as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> would that men should do to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, do<sup><small>+</small></sup> to them likewise.
6:22 And if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> love those who love you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, what thanks do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have? For even sinners love those who love them.
6:23 For even if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do good to those who do good to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, what thanks do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have? Even sinners do the same.
6:24 And if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> lend to them of whom you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hope to receive, what thanks is it to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much.
6:25 But love your<sup><small>+</small></sup> enemies, and do [them] good, and lend, never despairing; and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> reward will be great, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil. 
6:26 Be<sup><small>+</small></sup> merciful, even as your<sup><small>+</small></sup> Father is merciful. 
6:27 And do not judge, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not be judged: and do not condemn, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not be condemned: release, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be released: 
6:28 give, and it will be given to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will give into your<sup><small>+</small></sup> bosom. For with what measure you<sup><small>+</small></sup> mete it will be measured to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> again.
7:1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, he entered into Capernaum. 
7:2 And there came to him a captain, imploring him, 
7:3 and saying, Lord, my [young] slave lies in the house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. 
7:4 And he says to him, I will come and heal him. 
7:5 And the captain answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof; but only say the word, and my [young] slave will be healed. 
7:6 For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it. 
7:7 And when Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I have found no one with such faith in Israel. 
7:8 And Jesus said to the captain, Go your way; as you have believed, [so] be it done to you. And his [young] slave was healed in that hour.
7:9 Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent through his disciples 
7:10 and said to him, Are you he who comes, or do we look for another? 
7:11 And Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John the things which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hear and see: 
7:12 the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. 
7:13 And blessed is he, whoever will find no occasion of stumbling in me.
7:14 And as these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken with the wind? 
7:15 But what did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go out to see? A man clothed in soft [raiment]? Look, those who wear soft [raiment] are in kings' houses. 
7:16 But why did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and much more than a prophet. 
7:17 This is he, of whom it is written, Look, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.
7:18 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Among those who are born of women there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist; yet, he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
7:19 But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their fellows 
7:20 and say, We piped to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not dance; we wailed, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not mourn. 
7:21 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon. 
7:22 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Look, a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! And wisdom is acknowledged as right by her children.
7:23 Now when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the middle [of those present], and pleased Herod. 
7:24 Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask. 
7:25 And she, being put forward by her mother, says, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist. 
7:26 And being grieved, the king, because of his oaths and because of those who sat to eat with him, he commanded it to be given; 
7:27 and he sent and beheaded John in the prison. 
7:28 And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the girl: and she brought it to her mother. 
7:29 And his disciples came, and took up the corpse, and buried him.
7:30 And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness. 
7:31 And Jesus came into a house. And the multitude came together, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 
7:32 While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, look, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him. 
7:33 And one said to him, Look, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you. 
7:34 But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? And who are my brothers? 
7:35 And looking on those around him, he said, Here are my mother and my brothers. 
7:36 For whoever will do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
8:1 On that day Jesus went out of the house. 
8:2 And there were gathered to him great multitudes.
8:3 And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Look, the sower went forth to sow; 
8:4 and as he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them: 
8:5 and others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much earth: and right away they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth: 
8:6 and when the sun had risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. 
8:7 And others fell on the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them: 
8:8 and others fell on the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 
8:9 He who has ears, let him hear.
8:10 And the disciples came, and said to him, Why do you speak to them in parables? 
8:11 And he answered and said to them, To you<sup><small>+</small></sup> it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. 
8:12 For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance: but whoever does not have, from him will be taken away even that which he has. 
8:13 Therefore I speak to them in parables; because seeing they don't see, and hearing they don't hear, neither do they understand.
8:14 Then hear<sup><small>+</small></sup> the parable of the sower. 
8:15 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, [then] the evil [one] comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is he who was sown by the wayside. 
8:16 And he who was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and right away with joy receives it; 
8:17 yet he does not have root in himself, but endures for awhile; and when tribulation or persecution rises because of the word, right away he stumbles. 
8:18 And he who was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word; and the care of the age, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. 
8:19 And he who was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it; who truly bears fruit, and brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
8:20 He set another parable before the multitudes, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man who sowed good seed in his field: 
8:21 but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed weeds also among the wheat, and went away. 
8:22 But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the weeds also. 
8:23 And the slaves of the householder came and said to him, Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? From where then has it weeds? 
8:24 And he said to them, A hostile man has done this. And the slaves say to him, Will you then that we go and gather them up? 
8:25 But he says, No; lest perhaps while you<sup><small>+</small></sup> gather up the weeds, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> root up the wheat with them. 
8:26 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.
8:27 Another parable he set before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: 
8:28 which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in its branches.
8:29 Another parable he spoke to them; The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened.
8:30 All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable he spoke nothing to them. 
8:31 Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field. 
8:32 And he answered and said, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; 
8:33 and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the weeds are the sons of the evil [one]; 
8:34 and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the very end of the age; and the reapers are angels. 
8:35 As therefore the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so it will be in the very end of the age. 
8:36 The Son of Man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity, 
8:37 and will cast them into the furnace of fire. 
8:38 Then will the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.
9:1 Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he gave commandment to depart to the other side.
9:2 And when he had entered into the boat, his disciples followed him. 
9:3 And look, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. 
9:4 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Save, Lord; we perish. 
9:5 And he says to them, Why are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> fearful, O you<sup><small>+</small></sup> of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. 
9:6 And the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?
9:7 And when he came to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him a man possessed with demons coming forth out of the tombs who was so strong that no man could bind him.
9:8 And Jesus said to him, Come forth, you unclean spirit, out of the man. 
9:9 And he cried out, saying, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I urge you, don't torment me. 
9:10 And Jesus asked him, What is your name? 
9:11 And he says to him, My name is Legion; for we are many.
9:12 Now there was far off from them a herd of many swine being shepherded. 
9:13 And they implored him, saying, If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine. 
9:14 And he said to them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine: and look, the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea, and perished in the waters. 
9:15 And those who shepherded them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to him who was possessed with demons. 
9:16 And look, all the city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they implored [him] that he would depart from their borders.
9:17 And he entered into a boat, and crossed over.
9:18 And there came a ruler, and fell at his feet, saying, My daughter is at the point of death: come and lay your hands on her, and she will live. 
9:19 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and [so did] his disciples.
9:20 And look, a woman, who had a discharge of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: 
9:21 for she said to herself, If I do but touch his garment, I will be made whole. 
9:22 But Jesus turning and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.
9:23 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a tumult, 
9:24 he said, Do not weep; for the girl is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn. 
9:25 But when the crowd was put forth, he entered in, and took her by the hand; and the girl arose. 
9:26 And the news of this went forth into all that land.
9:27 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there. 
9:28 And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, From where has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? 
9:29 Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? And his brothers, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? 
9:30 And his sisters, are they not all with us? From where then has this man all these things? 
9:31 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house. 
9:32 And he did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
10:1 And Jesus called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. 
10:2 And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. 
10:3 And he said to them, Take nothing for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> journey, neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats each. 
10:4 And into whatever house you<sup><small>+</small></sup> enter, there stay, and from there depart. 
10:5 And as many as do not receive you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> depart from that city, shake off the dust from your<sup><small>+</small></sup> feet for a testimony against them. 
10:6 And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the good news, and healing everywhere.
10:7 At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, 
10:8 and said to his [household] slaves, This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead; and therefore these powers work in him.
10:9 And the apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus; and they told him all things that they had done, and that they had taught. 
10:10 And he says to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> come yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. 
10:11 And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart. 
10:12 And [the people] saw them going, and many knew [them], and they ran together there on foot from all the cities, and outwent them.
10:13 And he came forth and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
10:14 And when evening came, the disciples came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food. 
10:15 But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go away; you<sup><small>+</small></sup> give them to eat. 
10:16 And they say to him, We have here but five loaves, and two fish. 
10:17 And he said, Bring them here to me. 
10:18 And having commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fish, [and] having looked up to heaven, he blessed. And having broken the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples [gave] to the multitudes. 
10:19 And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full. 
10:20 And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
10:21 And right away he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him to the other side, until he should send the multitudes away. 
10:22 And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when evening came, he was there alone. 
10:23 But the boat was now a long distance away from the land, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary. 
10:24 And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. 
10:25 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear. 
10:26 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; don't be afraid. 
10:27 And when he got up into the boat, the wind ceased.
10:28 And when they had crossed over, they came to the land, to Gennesaret. 
10:29 And when the men of that place knew him, they sent into all around that region, and brought to him all who were sick; 
10:30 and they implored him that they might only touch the border of his garment: and as many as touched were made whole.
11:1 Then Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem come to Jesus, saying, 
11:2 Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they don't wash their hands when they eat bread. 
11:3 And he answered and said to them, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also transgress the commandment of God because of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tradition? 
11:4 For God said, Honor your father and your mother: and, He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him die the death. 
11:5 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say, Whoever will say to his father or his mother, That with which you might have been profited by me is given [to God]; 
11:6 he will not honor his father. And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have made void the word of God because of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> tradition. 
11:7 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> hypocrites, Isaiah prophesied well of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, saying, 
11:8 This people honors me with their lips; But their heart is far from me. 
11:9 But in vain they worship me, Teaching [as their] doctrines the precepts of men. 
11:10 And he called to him the multitude, and said to them, Hear<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and understand<sup><small>+</small></sup>: 
11:11 There is nothing from outside the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.
11:12 Then his disciples asked of him the parable. 
11:13 And he said to them, Are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> so without understanding also? 
11:14 Don't you<sup><small>+</small></sup> perceive, that whatever from outside goes into the man, [it] can't defile him; because it does not go into his heart, but into his belly, and goes out into the latrine? 
11:15 That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. 
11:16 For from inside, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, greed, wickednesses, deceit, sexual immorality, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness: 
11:17 all these evil things proceed from inside, and defile the man.
11:18 A good tree is not able to produce evil fruit, neither is a corrupt tree [able] to produce good fruit: for the tree is known by its fruit. For men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor do they gather figs of thistles. 
11:19 The good man out of his good treasure brings forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth evil things.
11:20 And Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
11:21 And look, a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. 
11:22 And she implored him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter. 
11:23 And he said to her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. 
11:24 But she answered and says to him, Lord, even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. 
11:25 And he said to her, For this saying go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter. 
11:26 And she went away to her house, and found the child laid on the bed, and the demon gone out.
11:27 And Jesus departed from there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there. 
11:28 And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, maimed, mute, and many others, and they cast them down at his feet; and he healed them: 
11:29 insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed whole, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified God.
11:30 And Jesus called to him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I don't want to send them away fasting, lest perhaps they faint on the way. 
11:31 And the disciples say to him, From where should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude? 
11:32 And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have? And they said, Seven, and a few small fish. 
11:33 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; 
11:34 and he took the seven loaves and the fish; and he gave thanks and broke, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. 
11:35 And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full. 
11:36 And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. 
11:37 And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.
11:38 And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven. 
11:39 But he answered and said to them, 
11:40 An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there will no sign be given to it, but the sign of Jonah. And he left them, and departed.
11:41 And the disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread. 
11:42 And Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 
11:43 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, We took no bread. 
11:44 And Jesus perceiving it said, O you<sup><small>+</small></sup> of little faith, why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> reason among yourselves, because you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have no bread? 
11:45 Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you<sup><small>+</small></sup> took up? 
11:46 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you<sup><small>+</small></sup> took up? 
11:47 How is it that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not perceive that I did not speak to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
12:1 Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is? 
12:2 And they said, Some [say] John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. 
12:3 He says to them, But who do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> say that I am? 
12:4 And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ. 
12:5 Then he charged the disciples that they should tell no man.
12:6 From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. 
12:7 And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from you, Lord: this will never happen to you. 
12:8 But he turned, and said to Peter, Get behind me, Satan: you are a stumbling-block to me: for you do not mind the things of God, but the things of men. 
12:9 Then Jesus said to his disciples, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 
12:10 For whoever would save his soul will lose it: and whoever will lose his soul for my sake will find it. 
12:11 For what will a man be profited, if he will gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul? 
12:12 For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he will render to each man according to his activity. 
12:13 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
12:14 And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart: 
12:15 and he was transfigured before them; and his face shone as the sun, and his garments became white as the light. 
12:16 And look, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him. 
12:17 And Peter answered, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if you will, I will make here three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. 
12:18 While he was yet speaking, look, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and look, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear<sup><small>+</small></sup> him. 
12:19 And then they saw no one, except Jesus only.
12:20 And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, except when the Son of Man should have risen again from the dead. 
12:21 And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean. 
12:22 And they asked him, saying, [How is it] that the scribes say that Elijah must first come? 
12:23 And he said to them, Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things: and how is it written of the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be set at nothing? 
12:24 But I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they would, even as it is written of him.
13:1 And when they had come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, and saying, 
13:2 Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water. 
13:3 And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him. 
13:4 And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? How long shall I bear with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? Bring him here to me. 
13:5 And Jesus rebuked him; and the demon went out of him: and the boy was cured from that hour.
13:6 And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men; 
13:7 and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up. And they were exceedingly sorry.
13:8 And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them might be the greatest. 
13:9 But Jesus knowing the reasoning of their heart, took a little child, and set him by his side, 
13:10 and said to them, Whoever will receive this little child in my name receives me: and whoever will receive me receives him who sent me: for he who is least among all of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, the same is great.
13:11 But whoever will cause one of these little ones to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. 
13:12 It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe to him, through whom the occasion comes! 
13:13 And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off: it is good for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. 
13:14 And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off: it is good for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into hell. 
13:15 And if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out: it is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.
13:16 And there came a scribe, and said to him, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go. 
13:17 And Jesus says to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven [have] nests; but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head. 
13:18 And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father. 
13:19 But Jesus says to him, Follow me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead.
14:1 And Jesus appointed seventy-two others, and sent them forth to preach the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and to heal the sick. And he said to them, 
14:2 The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the workers are few. Pray<sup><small>+</small></sup> therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth workers into his harvest. 
14:3 Go your<sup><small>+</small></sup> ways; Look, I send you<sup><small>+</small></sup> forth as sheep among wolves. 
14:4 Carry neither wallet, nor bag, nor sandals: 
14:5 for the worker is worthy of his food. 
14:6 And into whatever city or village you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will enter, search out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go forth. 
14:7 And as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> enter into the house, greet it. 
14:8 And if the house is worthy, let your<sup><small>+</small></sup> peace come upon it: but if it is not worthy, let your<sup><small>+</small></sup> peace return to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
14:9 He who receives you<sup><small>+</small></sup> receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me. 
14:10 And whoever will not receive you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, nor hear your<sup><small>+</small></sup> words, as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go forth out of that house or that city, shake off the dust of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> feet. 
14:11 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
14:12 Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works were done, because they did not repent. 
14:13 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
14:14 But I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
14:15 And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to Hades.
14:16 And the seventy-two returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name. 
14:17 And he said to them, I watched Satan fallen as lightning from heaven. 
14:18 Look, I have given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing will in any wise hurt you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
14:19 Nevertheless don't rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; but rejoice that your<sup><small>+</small></sup> names are written in heaven.
14:20 At that season Jesus answered and said, 
14:21 I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to juveniles: 
14:22 yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight. 
14:23 All things have been delivered to me of my Father: and no one knows the Son, except the Father; neither does any know the Father, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son wills to reveal [him].
14:24 And turning to the disciples, he said, Blessed [are] the eyes which see the things that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see; and the ears which hear the things that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hear. 
14:25 For truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see, and did not see them; and to hear the things which you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hear, and did not hear them.
14:26 And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples. 
14:27 And he said to them, When you<sup><small>+</small></sup> pray, say,
14:28 Father, Hallowed be your name.
14:29 Your kingdom come.
14:30 Give us this day our daily bread.
14:31 And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
14:32 And don't bring us into temptation. 
14:33 And I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Ask, and it will be given to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; Seek, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will find; Knock, and it will be opened to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>:
14:34 For everyone who asks receives; and He who seeks finds; and To him who knocks it will be opened.
14:35 Or what man is there of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, who, if his son will ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone; 
14:36 or if he will ask for a fish, will give him a serpent? 
14:37 If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> children, how much more will your<sup><small>+</small></sup> Father who is in heaven give good [things] to those who ask him?
15:1 Then was brought to him one possessed with a demon, blind and mute: and he healed him, insomuch that the mute man spoke and saw. 
15:2 And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David? 
15:3 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man does not cast out demons, but by Beelzebul the prince of the demons. 
15:4 And knowing their thoughts he said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself will not stand: 
15:5 and if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand? 
15:6 And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your<sup><small>+</small></sup> judges. 
15:7 But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
15:8 Or how can one enter into the house of the strong [man], and spoil his goods, except he first binds the strong [man]? And then he will spoil his house. 
15:9 He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters. 
15:10 Therefore I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 
15:11 And whoever will speak a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever will speak against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come.
15:12 But the unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it. 
15:13 Then he says, I will return into my house from where I came out; and when he has come, he finds it empty, swept, and garnished. 
15:14 Then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.
15:15 Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from you. 
15:16 But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet. 
15:17 The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and look, a greater than Jonah is here. 
15:18 The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and look, a greater than Solomon is here.
15:19 Now as he spoke, a Pharisee asks him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. 
15:20 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner. 
15:21 And the Lord said to him, Now you<sup><small>+</small></sup> Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but inside you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are full from extortion and lack of self-control. 
15:22 You blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup, that its outside may become clean also.
15:23 Woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> Pharisees! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law, justice, and mercy, and faith: but these you<sup><small>+</small></sup> ought to have done, and not to have left the other undone.
15:24 Woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> Pharisees! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the marketplaces.
15:25 Woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are as the tombs which do not appear, and the men who walk over [them] do not know it.
15:26 And one of the lawyers answering says to him, Teacher, in saying this you reproach us also.
15:27 And he said, Woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> lawyers also! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> bind loads that are heavy and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but you<sup><small>+</small></sup> yourselves will not move them with one of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fingers.
15:28 Woe to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>! For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the tombs of the righteous, 
15:29 and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in the blood of the prophets. 
15:30 Therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> witness to yourselves, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are sons of those who slew the prophets. 
15:31 You<sup><small>+</small></sup> fill up then the measure of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fathers.
15:32 Therefore, look, I send to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> prophets, and wise men, and scribes: some of them you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will kill and persecute: 
15:33 that on you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the sanctuary and the altar. 
15:34 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, All these things will come upon this generation.
15:35 And when he came out from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press on [him] vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things; 
15:36 laying wait for him, to catch something out of his mouth.
15:37 In the mean time, when the multitude was gathered together, he began to say to his disciples first of all, 
15:38 Don't fear them: for there is nothing covered, that will not be revealed; and hid, that will not be known. 
15:39 What I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the darkness, speak<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the light; and what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> hear in the ear, proclaim on the housetops. 
15:40 A city set on a hill can't be hid. 
15:41 Neither do [men] light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the lampstand; and it shines to all who are in the house. 
15:42 And don't be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 
15:43 Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? and not one of them will fall on the ground without your<sup><small>+</small></sup> Father: 
15:44 but the very hairs of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> head are all numbered. 
15:45 Don't be afraid therefore: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are of more value than many sparrows.
15:46 Everyone therefore who will confess me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven. 
15:47 But whoever will deny me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.
15:48 Don't think that I came to send peace on the earth: I didn't come to send peace, but a sword. 
15:49 For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law: 
15:50 and a man's foes [will be] those of his own household.
16:1 And one out of the multitude said to him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me. 
16:2 But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? 
16:3 And he said to them, Take heed, and keep yourselves from all greed: for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of the things which he possesses.
16:4 And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: 
16:5 and he reasoned to himself, saying, What shall I do, because I don't have a place to bestow my fruits? 
16:6 And he said, I will do this: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there I will bestow all my grain and my goods. 
16:7 And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry. 
16:8 But God said to him, You foolish one, this [is] the night they demand back your soul from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be? 
16:9 So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
16:10 And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Don't be anxious for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> soul, what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will eat, or what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will drink; nor yet for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> body, what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will put on. Is not the soul more than food, and the body than clothing? 
16:11 Look at the birds of the heaven, that they do not sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you<sup><small>+</small></sup> of much more value than they? 
16:12 And which of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> by being anxious can add one cubit to the measure of his life? 
16:13 And why are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> anxious concerning clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil, neither do they spin: 
16:14 yet I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 
16:15 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is [here], and tomorrow is cast into the oven, [will he] not much more [clothe] you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, O you<sup><small>+</small></sup> of little faith? 
16:16 Therefore don't be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? Or, What shall we drink? Or, With what shall we be clothed? 
16:17 For after all these things the Gentiles seek; for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> heavenly Father knows that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have need of all these things. 
16:18 But seek<sup><small>+</small></sup> first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things will be added to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
16:19 Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth consumes, and where thieves break through: 
16:20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth does not consume, neither do thieves break through: 
16:21 for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
16:22 Let your<sup><small>+</small></sup> loins be girded about, and your<sup><small>+</small></sup> lamps burning; 
16:23 and be<sup><small>+</small></sup> yourselves like men looking for their lord, when he will return from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may right away open to him. 
16:24 Blessed are those slaves, whom the lord when he comes will find watching: truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that he will gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and will come and serve them. 
16:25 And if he will come in the second watch, and if in the third, and find [them] so, blessed are those [slaves].
16:26 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken through. 
16:27 Therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also be ready; for in an hour that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not think the Son of Man comes.
16:28 Who then is the faithful and wise slave, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season? 
16:29 Blessed is that slave, whom his lord when he comes will find so doing. 
16:30 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that he will set him over all that he has. 
16:31 But if that evil slave says in his heart, My lord tarries; 
16:32 and begins to beat his fellow slaves, and to eat and drink, and to be drunk; 
16:33 the lord of that slave will come in a day when he does not expect, and in an hour when he does not know, 
16:34 and will cut him apart, and appoint his portion with the unfaithful.
16:35 For as [were] the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 
16:36 For as in those days which were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, 
16:37 and they didn't know until the flood came, and took them all away; so also will be the coming of the Son of Man. 
16:38 Then will two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left: 
16:39 two women [will be] grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.
16:40 And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and journeying on to Jerusalem.
17:1 And one said to him, Lord, are there few who are saved? And he said to them, 
17:2 Strive to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, will seek to enter in, and will not be able. 
17:3 When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut to the door, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he will answer and say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I don't know you<sup><small>+</small></sup> or where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are from. 
17:4 Then you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will begin to say, We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets; 
17:5 and he will speak, saying to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I don't know you<sup><small>+</small></sup> or where you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are from; depart from me, all you<sup><small>+</small></sup> workers of iniquity.
17:6 Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
17:7 Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, will be likened to a wise man, who built his house on the rock: 
17:8 and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it did not fall: for it was founded on the rock. 
17:9 And everyone who hears these words of mine, and does not do them, will be likened to a foolish man, who built his house on the sand: 
17:10 and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and struck against that house; and it fell: and great was its fall.
17:11 And I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: 
17:12 but the sons of the kingdom will be cast forth into the outer darkness: there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
17:13 In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get out, and go from here: for Herod wants to kill you. 
17:14 And he said to them, Go and say to that fox, Look, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third [day] I am perfected. 
17:15 Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the [day] following: for it cannot be that a prophet perishes out of Jerusalem.
17:16 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not want [to]! 
17:17 Look, your<sup><small>+</small></sup> house is left to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
17:18 For I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> will not see me from now on, until you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will say, Blessed [is] he who comes in the name of Yahweh.
17:19 And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him. 
17:20 And look, there was before him a certain man who had the dropsy. 
17:21 And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not? 
17:22 But they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go. 
17:23 And he said to them, What man will there be of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that will have one sheep, and if this falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? 
17:24 And they could not answer again to these things.
17:25 And he spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying to them, 
17:26 When you are invited of any man to a marriage feast, don't sit down in the chief seat; lest perhaps a more honorable man than you be invited of him, 
17:27 and he who invited you and him will come and say to you, Give this man place; and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. 
17:28 But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he who has invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher: then you will have glory in the presence of all who sit at meat with you. 
17:29 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled; and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
17:30 And he said to him also that had invited him, When you make a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest perhaps they also bid you again, and a recompense be made you. 
17:31 But when you make a feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: 
17:32 and you will be blessed; because they don't have [the means] to recompense you: for you will be recompensed in the resurrection of the just. 
17:33 And when one of those who sat to eat with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he who will eat bread in the kingdom of God.
17:34 But he said to him, A certain man made a great supper; and he invited many: 
17:35 and he sent forth his slave at supper time to say to those who were invited, Come; for [all] things are now ready. 
17:36 And they all with one [consent] began to make excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I must surely go out and see it; I pray you have me excused. 
17:37 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray you have me excused. 
17:38 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I can't come. 
17:39 And the slave came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his slave, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and maimed and blind and lame. 
17:40 And the slave said, Lord, what you commanded is done, and yet there is room. 
17:41 And the lord said to the slave, Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain [them] to come in, that my house may be filled. 
17:42 For I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.
18:1 Now there went with him great multitudes: and he turned, and said to them, 
18:2 He who loves father or mother more than me can't be my disciple; and he who loves son or daughter more than me can't be my disciple. 
18:3 And he who does not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.
18:4 For which of you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has [the means] to complete it? 
18:5 Lest perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all who watch begin to mock him, 
18:6 saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. 
18:7 Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? 
18:8 Otherwise, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an ambassador, and asks the [conditions] of peace. 
18:9 So therefore whoever he is of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who does not renounce all that he has, he can't be my disciple.
18:10 Salt therefore is good: but if the salt has lost its savor, how will it be salted? It is from then on good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.
19:1 Now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near to him to hear him. 
19:2 And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receives sinners, and eats with them. 
19:3 And he spoke to them this parable, saying, 
19:4 What do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> think? If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine, and go to search for that which goes astray? 
19:5 And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray. 
19:6 I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that even so there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, [more] than over ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no repentance.
19:7 And he said, A certain man had two sons: 
19:8 and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of [your] substance that falls to me. And he divided to them his living. 
19:9 And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living. 
19:10 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. 
19:11 And he went and stuck [close] to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to shepherd swine. 
19:12 And he desired to have filled his belly with the pods that the swine ate: and no man gave to him. 
19:13 But when he came to himself he said, How many hired workers of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger! 
19:14 I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight: 
19:15 I am no more worthy to be called your<sup><small>+</small></sup> son: make me as one of your hired workers. 
19:16 And he arose, and came to his father.
19:17 But while he was yet far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. 
19:18 And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight: I am no more worthy to be called your son. 
19:19 But the father said to his slaves, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet: 
19:20 and bring the fatted calf, [and] kill it, and let us eat, and make merry: 
19:21 for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
19:22 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. 
19:23 And he called to him one of the [household] slaves, and inquired what these things might be. 
19:24 And he said to him, Your brother has come; and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound. 
19:25 But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came out, and entreated him. 
19:26 But he answered and said to his father, Look, these many years I serve you as a slave, and I never transgressed a commandment of yours; and [yet] you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends: 
19:27 but when this your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed for him the fatted calf. 
19:28 And he said to him, Child, you are ever with me, and all that is mine is yours. 
19:29 But it was meet to make merry and be glad: for this your brother was dead, and is alive [again]; and [was] lost, and is found.
20:1 And he said also to the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he was wasting his goods. 
20:2 And he called him, and said to him, What is this that I hear of you? Render the account of your stewardship; for you can no longer be steward. 
20:3 And the steward said to himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord takes away the stewardship from me? I don't have strength to dig; I am ashamed to beg. 
20:4 I have resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. 
20:5 And calling to him each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much do you owe to my lord? 
20:6 And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty. 
20:7 Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He says to him, Take your bond, and write eighty. 
20:8 And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this age are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light. 
20:9 And I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it will fail, they may receive you<sup><small>+</small></sup> into the eternal tabernacles.
20:10 He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he who is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much. 
20:11 If therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> haven't been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your<sup><small>+</small></sup> trust the true [riches]? 
20:12 And if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> haven't been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> that which is your<sup><small>+</small></sup> own?
20:13 No man can serve as a slave to two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will hold to one, and despise the other. You<sup><small>+</small></sup> can't serve as a slave to God and mammon.
20:14 And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him. 
20:15 And he said to them, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knows your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hearts: for that which is exalted among men is disgusting in the sight of God.
20:16 And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation: 
20:17 If therefore they will say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Look, he is in the wilderness; don't go forth: Look, he is in the inner chambers; don't believe [it]. 
20:18 For as the lightning comes forth from the east, and is seen even to the west; so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
20:19 Wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.
20:20 And he arose from there and comes into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan: and multitudes come together to him again; and, as he was accustomed, he taught them again.
20:21 And Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to divorce [his] wife? trying him. 
20:22 And he answered and said to them, What did Moses command you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? 
20:23 And they said, Moses allowed to write a bill of divorce, and to divorce. 
20:24 But Jesus said to them, For your<sup><small>+</small></sup> hardness of heart he wrote you<sup><small>+</small></sup> this commandment. 
20:25 But from the beginning of the creation, Male and female he made them. 
20:26 For this cause will a man leave his father and mother, and will stick to his wife; 
20:27 and the two will become one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh. 
20:28 What therefore God has joined together, let man not separate. 
20:29 And in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter. 
20:30 And he says to them, Everyone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery.
20:31 Then there were brought to him little children, that he should touch them: and the disciples rebuked them. 
20:32 But Jesus said, Allow the little children to come to me, and don't forbid them: for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 
20:33 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he will in no way enter in it.
20:34 And as he was going forth into the way, one ran to him, and knelt to him, and asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? 
20:35 And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? None is good but one, God. 
20:36 You know the commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and your mother. 
20:37 And he said to him, Teacher, all these things I have observed from my youth. 
20:38 And Jesus looking on him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. 
20:39 But his countenance fell at the saying, and he went away sorrowful: for he was one who had great possessions.
20:40 And Jesus looked around, and says to his disciples, How hardly will those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
20:41 And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answers again, and says to them, Children, how hard it is to enter into the kingdom of God! 
20:42 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
20:43 And they were exceedingly astonished, saying to themselves, Then who can be saved? 
20:44 Jesus looking on them says, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God. 
20:45 Peter began to say to him, Look, we have left all, and have followed you. 
20:46 Jesus said, Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, There is no man who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for the sake of me, and for the sake of the good news, 
20:47 but he [who] will receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life. But many [who are] first will be last; and the last first.
21:1 And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said to them, 
21:2 Look, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes; and they will condemn him to death, 
21:3 and will deliver him to the Gentiles; and they will mock him, and will spit on him, and will scourge him, and will kill him; and the third day he will be raised up.
21:4 And as they drew near to Jericho, a great multitude followed him. 
21:5 And look, a blind man sitting by the wayside, when he heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, Jesus, Son of David. 
21:6 And the multitude rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on me, Son of David. 
21:7 And Jesus stood still, and called him, and said, What do you want that I should do to you? 
21:8 He says to him, Lord, that I may receive my sight. 
21:9 And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him.
21:10 And he entered and was passing through Jericho. 
21:11 And look, a man called by name Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich. 
21:12 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature. 
21:13 And he ran on before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. 
21:14 And when he came to the place, Jesus looked up, and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry, and come down; for today I must stay at your house. 
21:15 And he hurried, and came down, and received him joyfully. 
21:16 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner. 
21:17 And Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord, Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted anything of any man, I restore fourfold. 
21:18 And Jesus said to him, Today has salvation come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. 
21:19 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.
21:20 And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and [because] they supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear.
21:21 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. 
21:22 And he called ten slaves of his, and gave them ten minas, and said to them, Trade<sup><small>+</small></sup> until I come. 
21:23 But his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassador after him, saying, We will not have this man reign over us. 
21:24 And it came to pass, when he came back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these slaves, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading. 
21:25 And the first came before him, saying, Lord, your mina has made ten minas more. 
21:26 And he said to him, Well done, you good slave: because you were found faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities. 
21:27 And the second came, saying, Your mina, Lord, has made five minas. 
21:28 And he said to him also, You also be over five cities. 
21:29 And another came, saying, Lord, look, [here is] your mina, which I kept laid up in a napkin: 
21:30 for I feared you, because you are an austere man: you take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow. 
21:31 He says to him, Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked slave. You knew that I am an austere man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow; 
21:32 then why didn't you give my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have collected it with interest? 
21:33 And he said to those who stood by, Take away from him the mina, and give it to him who has the ten minas. 
21:34 And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas. 
21:35 I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that to everyone who has will be given; but from him who has not, even that which he has will be taken away. 
21:36 But these enemies of mine, who did not want that I should reign over them, bring here, and slay them before me.
22:1 And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 
22:2 saying to them, Go into the village that is across from you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and right away you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will find a colt tied: loose him, and bring him to me. 
22:3 And if anyone says anything to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will say, The Lord has need of him; and right away he will send him. 
22:4 And the disciples went, and did even as Jesus appointed them, 
22:5 and brought the colt, and put their garments on him; and he sat on him. 
22:6 And many spread their garments in the way; and others cut branches from the trees, and spread them in the way. 
22:7 And those who went before him, and who followed, cried, saying, Hosanna: Blessed [is] he who comes in the name of Yahweh; Hosanna in the highest.
22:8 And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked around on all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
22:9 Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he was hungry. 
22:10 And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he came to it, and found nothing on it, but leaves only; and he says to it, No longer from you will there be fruit, forever. And his disciples heard it.
22:11 And Jesus entered into the temple, and cast out all those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves; 
22:12 and he says to them, It is written, My house will be called a house of prayer: but you<sup><small>+</small></sup> make it a den of robbers. 
22:13 And when evening came they went forth out of the city.
22:14 And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. 
22:15 And Peter calling to remembrance says to him, Rabbi, look, the fig tree which you cursed is withered away. 
22:16 And Jesus answering says to them, Have faith in God. 
22:17 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Whoever will say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea; and will not doubt in his heart, but will believe that what he says comes to pass; he will have it. 
22:18 Therefore I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, All things that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> pray and ask for, believe that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> receive them, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will have them.
22:19 And when he came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority? 
22:20 And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you<sup><small>+</small></sup> one question, which if you<sup><small>+</small></sup> tell me, I likewise will tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup> by what authority I do these things. 
22:21 The baptism of John, from where was it? From heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we will say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not believe him? 
22:22 But if we will say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet. 
22:23 And they answered Jesus, and said, We don't know. He also said to them, Neither do I tell you<sup><small>+</small></sup> by what authority I do these things.
22:24 And he spoke to them in parables, saying, There was a man who was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country. 
22:25 And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his slaves to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits. 
22:26 And the husbandmen took his slaves, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. 
22:27 Again, he sent other slaves more than the first: and they did to them in like manner. 
22:28 But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. 
22:29 But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance. 
22:30 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard. 
22:31 What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? 
22:32 He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. 
22:33 Have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not read even this Scripture, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; This was from Yahweh, And it is marvelous in our eyes?
22:34 And when they heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them. 
22:35 And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes.
23:1 Then they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in [his] talk. 
23:2 And when they had come, they say to him, Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, and do not care about [what] anyone [thinks]: for you do not regard the person of men. 
23:3 Tell us therefore, What do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 
23:4 But Jesus perceived their hypocrisy, and said, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> make trial of me? 
23:5 Show me the tribute money. And they brought to him a denarius. 
23:6 And he says to them, Whose is this image and superscription? 
23:7 They say to him, Caesar's. Then he says to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's. 
23:8 And when they heard it, they marveled.
23:9 And there came to him Sadducees, those who say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him, 
23:10 saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother will marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother. 
23:11 Now there were with us seven brothers: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed, left his wife to his brother; 
23:12 in like manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh. 
23:13 And after them all, the woman died. 
23:14 In the resurrection therefore whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her. 
23:15 But Jesus answered and said to them, Is it not for this cause that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> err, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't know the Scriptures, nor the power of God? 
23:16 For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven. 
23:17 But as concerning the dead, that they are raised; have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not read in the Book of Moses, in [the place concerning] the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 
23:18 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not [the God] of the dead, but of the living.
23:19 And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and having seeing that he answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all? 
23:20 Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O Israel; Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one: 
23:21 and you will love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength. 
23:22 The second is this, You will love your fellow man as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. 
23:23 And no man after that dared ask him any question.
23:24 And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, How do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? 
23:25 David himself said in the Holy Spirit, Yahweh said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, Until I set your enemies under your feet. 
23:26 David himself calls him Lord; and how is he his son? And the large crowd heard him gladly.
23:27 And in his teaching he said, Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and [to have] salutations in the marketplaces, 
23:28 and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts: 
23:29 those who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation.
24:1 And Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way; and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple. 
24:2 But he answered and said to them, Do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not see all these things? Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, There will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down.
24:3 And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? And what [will be] the sign of your coming, and of the very end of the age? 
24:4 And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man leads you<sup><small>+</small></sup> astray. 
24:5 For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and will lead many astray. 
24:6 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are not troubled: for [these things] must surely come to pass; but the end is not yet. 
24:7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in diverse places. 
24:8 But all these things are the beginning of travail.
24:9 But beware of men: for they will deliver you<sup><small>+</small></sup> up to Sanhedrins, and in their synagogues they will scourge you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; 
24:10 yes and before governors and kings you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. 
24:11 But when they deliver you<sup><small>+</small></sup> up, don't be anxious how or what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will speak: for it will be given you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in that hour what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will speak. 
24:12 For it is not you<sup><small>+</small></sup> who speak, but the Spirit of your<sup><small>+</small></sup> Father who speaks in you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. 
24:13 And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child: and children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death. 
24:14 And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.
24:15 When therefore you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see the detestable thing of desolation (let him who reads understand), 
24:16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains: 
24:17 let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house: 
24:18 and let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak. 
24:19 But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse in those days! 
24:20 And pray<sup><small>+</small></sup> that your<sup><small>+</small></sup> flight not be in the winter. 
24:21 For then will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor will ever be. 
24:22 And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect's sake those days will be shortened. 
24:23 Then if any man says to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Look, here is the Christ, or, Look, there; don't believe [it]. 
24:24 For there will arise false Christs, and false prophets, and will show great signs and wonders; so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. 
24:25 But take<sup><small>+</small></sup> heed: I have told you<sup><small>+</small></sup> all things beforehand.
24:26 But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 
24:27 And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. 
24:28 And then he will send forth the angels, and will gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
24:29 Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know that the summer is near; 
24:30 even so you<sup><small>+</small></sup> also, when you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see all these things, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> know that he is near, [even] at the doors. 
24:31 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, This generation will not pass away, until all these things are accomplished. 
24:32 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
25:1 Now after two days will be the Passover, 
25:2 and the chief priests, and the elders of the people were gathered together, to the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas; 
25:3 and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him. 
25:4 But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among the people.
25:5 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 
25:6 there came to him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceedingly precious ointment, and she poured it on his head, as he sat to eat. 
25:7 But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? 
25:8 For this [ointment] might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. 
25:9 But Jesus perceiving it said to them, Why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> trouble the woman? For she has worked a good work on me. 
25:10 For you<sup><small>+</small></sup> always have the poor with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>; but me you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not always have. 
25:11 For in that she poured this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. 
25:12 Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, Wherever this good news will be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her.
25:13 Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them. 
25:14 And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. 
25:15 And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him [to them].
25:16 Now on the first [day] of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover? 
25:17 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is at hand; I keep the Passover at your house with my disciples. 
25:18 And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the Passover.
25:19 Now when evening came, he was sitting at meat with the twelve; 
25:20 and as they were eating, he said, Truly I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, that one of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will deliver me up. 
25:21 And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and began to say to him each one, Is it I, Lord? 
25:22 And he answered and said, He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will deliver me up. 
25:23 The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him: but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up! Good were it for that man if he had not been born.
25:24 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. 
25:25 And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, 
25:26 This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. 
25:27 But I say to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in my Father's kingdom.
25:28 Then came to him the sons of Zebedee, asking a certain thing of him. 
25:29 And he said to them, What do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> want? They say to him, Say that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your kingdom. 
25:30 But Jesus answered and said, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't know what you<sup><small>+</small></sup> ask. Are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say to him, We are able. 
25:31 He says to them, My cup indeed you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will drink: but to sit at my right hand, and on [my] left hand, this is not mine to give; but [it is for those] for whom it has been prepared.
25:32 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brothers. 
25:33 But Jesus called them to him, and said, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and those who have authority over them are called Benefactors. 
25:34 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> [will] not [be] so: but he who is the greater among you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, let him become as the younger; and he who is chief, as he who serves. 
25:35 For which is greater, he who sits at meat, or he who serves? Isn't it he who sits at meat? But I am among you<sup><small>+</small></sup> as he who serves.
25:36 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are those who have continued with me in my trials; 
25:37 and I appoint to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, even as my Father appointed to me, a kingdom, 
25:38 that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
25:39 Then Jesus says to them, All you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered abroad. 
25:40 But Peter answered and said to him, If all will be offended in you, I will never be offended. 
25:41 Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me thrice. 
25:42 Peter says to him, Even if I must die with you, [yet] I will not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.
26:1 Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and says to his disciples, Sit<sup><small>+</small></sup> here, while I go yonder and pray. 
26:2 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very troubled. 
26:3 Then he says to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death: stay<sup><small>+</small></sup> here, and watch with me. 
26:4 And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will. 
26:5 And he comes to the disciples, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, What, could you<sup><small>+</small></sup> not watch with me one hour? 
26:6 Watch and pray, that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> don't enter into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 
26:7 Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, your will be done. 
26:8 And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 
26:9 And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words. 
26:10 Then he comes to the disciples, and says to them, Are you<sup><small>+</small></sup> still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is delivered up into the hands of sinners. 
26:11 Arise, let us be going: look, he is at hand who delivers me up.
26:12 And while he yet spoke, look, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 
26:13 Now he that delivered him up gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I will kiss, that is he: take him. 
26:14 And right away he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him. 
26:15 Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. 
26:16 And look, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and took off his ear. 
26:17 Jesus says to him, Return your sword to its place. 
26:18 Then Jesus said to the multitudes, Have you<sup><small>+</small></sup> come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> did not take me. 
26:19 But all this has come to pass, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.
26:20 And those who had taken Jesus led him away to [the house of] Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. 
26:21 But Peter followed him from far off, to the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the attendants, to see the end. 
26:22 Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin sought witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death; 
26:23 and they did not find it, though many false witnesses came. But afterward, two came forward 
26:24 who said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. 
26:25 And the high priest stood up, and said to him, Do you answer nothing? What is it which these witness against you? 
26:26 But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him, Tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God. 
26:27 Jesus says to him, You have said. And you<sup><small>+</small></sup> will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. 
26:28 Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He has spoken blasphemy: what further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have heard the blasphemy. 
26:29 What do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> think? They answered and said, He is worthy of death. 
26:30 Then they spat in his face and buffeted him. And some struck him with the palms of their hands, 
26:31 saying, Prophesy to us, Christ. Who is he that struck you?
26:32 Now Peter was sitting outside in the court: and a female slave came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus the Galilean. 
26:33 But he denied before them all, saying, I don't know what you say. 
26:34 And when he had gone out into the porch, another [female slave] saw him, and she says to those who were there, This man was with Jesus of Nazareth. 
26:35 And again he denied with an oath, I don't know the man. 
26:36 And after a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth you also are [one] of them; for your speech makes you known. 
26:37 Then he began to curse and to swear, I don't know the man. And right away the rooster crowed. 
26:38 And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the rooster crows, you will deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
27:1 Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: 
27:2 and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor.
27:3 Now Jesus was standing before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said, You say. 
27:4 And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. 
27:5 Then Pilate says to him, Don't you hear how many things they witness against you? 
27:6 And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marveled greatly.
27:7 Now at the feast the governor would usually release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they wanted. 
27:8 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. 
27:9 When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> want that I release to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>? Barabbas or Jesus? 
27:10 And they said, Barabbas. 
27:11 Pilate says to them, What then shall I do to Jesus? They all say, Let him be crucified. 
27:12 And he said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified. 
27:13 So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, 
27:14 he released to them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.
27:15 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered to him the whole battalion. 
27:16 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. 
27:17 And they platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head; and they knelt down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 
27:18 And they spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. 
27:19 And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify him. 
27:20 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: they compelled him to go [with them], that he might bear his cross.
27:21 And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull, 
27:22 they offered him wine mingled with gall: but he did not receive it. 
27:23 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots; 
27:24 and they sat and watched him there. 
27:25 And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
27:26 Then there are crucified with him two robbers, one on the right and one on the left. 
27:27 And those who passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, 
27:28 and saying, You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days: save yourself, if you are the Son of God, and come down from the cross. 
27:29 In like manner also the chief priests mocking [him], with the scribes and elders, said, 
27:30 He saved others; himself he can't save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him. 
27:31 He trusts on God; let him deliver [him] now, if he desires him: for he said, I am the Son of God. 
27:32 And the robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.
27:33 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. 
27:34 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani? That is, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? 
27:35 And some of those who stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calls Elijah. 
27:36 And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. 
27:37 And the rest said, Let [him] be; let us see whether Elijah comes to save him. 
27:38 And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit. 
27:39 And look, the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom in two.
27:40 Now the captain who was watching Jesus, when he saw what happened, said, Truly this was the Son of God. 
27:41 And many women were there watching from far, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him: 
27:42 among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
27:43 And when evening came, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: 
27:44 this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up. 
27:45 And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 
27:46 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed. 
27:47 And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting across from the tomb.
28:1 Now late on the Sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. 
28:2 And look, an angel appeared. His appearance was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow. 
28:3 And the angel said to the women, Don't be<sup><small>+</small></sup> afraid; for I know that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> seek Jesus, who has been crucified. 
28:4 He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying. 
28:5 And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear, and fled.
