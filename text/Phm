1:1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and coworker, 
1:2 and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in your house: 
1:3 Grace to you<sup><small>+</small></sup> and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1:4 I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, 
1:5 hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints; 
1:6 that the fellowship of your faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us, to Christ. 
1:7 For I had much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
1:8 Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin you [to do] that which is befitting, 
1:9 yet for love's sake I rather urge, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus: 
1:10 I urge you for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus, 
1:11 who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable both to you and to me: 
1:12 whom I have sent back to you in his own person, that is, my very heart: 
1:13 whom I was hoping to keep with me, that in your behalf he might serve me in the bonds of the good news: 
1:14 but without your mind I would do nothing; that your goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will. 
1:15 For perhaps he was therefore parted [from you] for a season, that you should have him forever; 
1:16 no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 
1:17 If then you count me a partner, receive him as [you would] me. 
1:18 But if he has wronged you at all, or owes [you] anything, put that to my account; 
1:19 I Paul write it with my own hand, I will repay it: that I should not have to say to you that you owe to me even your own self besides. 
1:20 Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.
1:21 Having confidence in your obedience I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say. 
1:22 But as well, also prepare a lodging for me: for I hope that through your<sup><small>+</small></sup> prayers I will be granted to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
1:23 Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you; 
1:24 [and so do] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my coworkers.
1:25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your<sup><small>+</small></sup> spirit.
