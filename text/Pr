1:1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:
1:2 To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;
1:3 To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;
1:4 To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:
1:5 That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsels:
1:6 To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
1:7 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; [But] the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
1:8 My son, hear the instruction of your father, And don't forsake the law of your mother:
1:9 For they will be a chaplet of grace to your head, And chains about your neck.
1:10 My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent.
1:11 If they say, Come with us, Let us lay in wait for blood; Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;
1:12 Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those who go down into the pit;
1:13 We will find all precious substance; We will fill our houses with spoil;
1:14 You will cast your lot among us; We will all have one bag:
1:15 My son, don't walk in the way with them; Refrain your foot from their path:
1:17 For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird:
1:18 And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk secretly for their own souls.
1:19 So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain; It takes away the soul of its owners.
1:20 Wisdom cries aloud in the street; She utters her voice in the broad places;
1:21 She cries in the most noisy places; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she utters her words:
1:22 How long, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> simple ones, will you<sup><small>+</small></sup> love simplicity? And scoffers delight themselves in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?
1:23 Turn<sup><small>+</small></sup> at my reproof: Look, I will cause my spirit to gush out on you<sup><small>+</small></sup> I will make my words known to you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
1:24 Because I have called, and you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man has regarded;
1:25 But you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have set at nothing all my counsel, And would have none of my reproof:
1:26 I also will laugh in [the day of] your<sup><small>+</small></sup> calamity; I will mock when your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fear comes;
1:27 When your<sup><small>+</small></sup> fear comes as a storm, And your<sup><small>+</small></sup> calamity comes on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you<sup><small>+</small></sup>.
1:28 Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me:
1:29 For they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Yahweh:
1:30 They didn't want my counsel; They despised all my reproof.
1:31 Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.
1:32 For the backsliding of the simple will slay them, And the careless ease of fools will destroy them.
1:33 But whoever harkens to me will stay securely, And will be quiet without fear of evil.
2:1 My son, if you will receive my words, And lay up my commandments with you;
2:2 So as to incline your ear to wisdom, And apply your heart to understanding;
2:3 Yes, if you cry after discernment, And lift up your voice for understanding;
2:4 If you seek her as silver, And search for her as for hidden treasures:
2:5 Then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, And find knowledge of God.
2:6 For Yahweh gives wisdom; Out of his mouth [comes] knowledge and understanding:
2:7 He lays up sound wisdom for the upright; [He is] a shield to those who walk in integrity;
2:8 That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints.
2:9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, And equity, [yes,] every good path.
2:10 For wisdom will enter into your heart, And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
2:11 Discretion will watch over you; Understanding will keep you:
2:12 To deliver you from the way of evil, From the men who speak perverse things;
2:13 Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;
2:14 Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil;
2:15 Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths:
2:16 To deliver you from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;
2:17 Who forsakes the best friend of her youth, And forgets the covenant of her God:
2:18 For her house inclines to death, And her paths to the spirits of the dead;
2:19 None who go to her return again, Neither do they attain to the paths of life:
2:20 That you may walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.
2:21 For the upright will stay in the land, And the perfect will be left in it.
2:22 But the wicked will be cut off from the land, And betrayers will be rooted out of it.
3:1 My son, do not forget my law; But let your heart keep my commandments:
3:2 For length of days, and years of life, And peace, they will add to you.
3:3 Don't let kindness and truth forsake you: Bind them about your neck;
3:4 So you will find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man.
3:5 Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding:
3:6 In all your ways acknowledge him, And he will direct your paths.
3:7 Don't be wise in your own eyes; Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil:
3:8 It will be health to your navel, And marrow to your bones.
3:9 Honor Yahweh with your substance, And with the first fruits of all your increase:
3:10 So your barns will be filled with corn, And your vats will overflow with new wine.
3:11 My son, don't despise the chastening of Yahweh; Neither be weary of his reproof:
3:12 For whom Yahweh loves he reproves; Even as a father the son in whom he delights.
3:13 Happy is [the] man who finds wisdom, And [the] man who gets understanding.
3:14 For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver, And its profit than fine gold.
3:15 She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.
3:16 Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.
3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.
3:18 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold on her: And happy is everyone who retains her.
3:19 Yahweh by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens.
3:20 By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew.
3:21 My son, don't let them depart from your eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion:
3:22 So they will be life to your soul, And grace to your neck.
3:23 Then you will walk in your way securely, And your foot will not stumble.
3:24 When you lie down, you will not be afraid: Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.
3:25 Don't be afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:
3:26 For Yahweh will be your confidence, And will keep your foot from being taken.
3:27 Don't withhold good from them to whom it is due, When it is in the power of your hand to do it.
3:28 Don't say to your fellow man, Go, and come again, And tomorrow I will give; When you have it by you.
3:29 Don't devise evil against your fellow man Who dwells securely by you.
3:30 Don't strive with man without cause, If he has done you no harm.
3:31 Don't envy the man of violence, And choose none of his ways.
3:32 For the perverse is disgusting to Yahweh; But his friendship is with the upright.
3:33 The curse of Yahweh is in the house of the wicked; But he blesses the habitation of the righteous.
3:34 Surely he scoffs at the scoffers; But he gives grace to the lowly.
3:35 The wise will inherit glory; But shame will be the promotion of fools.
4:1 Hear, [my] sons, the instruction of a father, And attend to know understanding:
4:2 For I give you<sup><small>+</small></sup> good doctrine; Don't forsake<sup><small>+</small></sup> my law.
4:3 For I was a son to my father, Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
4:4 And he taught me, and said to me: Let your heart retain my words; Keep my commandments, and live;
4:5 Get wisdom, get understanding; Don't forget, neither decline from the words of my mouth;
4:6 Don't forsake her, and she will preserve you; Love her, and she will keep you.
4:7 Wisdom [is] the principal thing; [therefore] get wisdom; Yes, with all your getting get understanding.
4:8 Exalt her, and she will promote you; She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her.
4:9 She will give to your head a chaplet of grace; A crown of beauty she will deliver to you.
4:10 Hear, my son, and receive my sayings; And the years of your life will be many.
4:11 I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in paths of uprightness.
4:12 When you go, your steps will not be straitened; And if you run, you will not stumble.
4:13 Take fast hold of instruction; don't let her go: Keep her; for she is your life.
4:14 Don't enter into the path of the wicked, And don't walk in the way of evil men.
4:15 Avoid it, don't pass by it; Turn from it, and pass on.
4:16 For they don't sleep, except they do evil; And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
4:17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.
4:18 But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, That shines more and more to the perfect day.
4:19 The way of the wicked is as darkness: They don't know at what they stumble.
4:20 My son, attend to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings.
4:21 Don't let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the midst of your heart.
4:22 For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh.
4:23 Keep your heart with all diligence; For out of it are the issues of life.
4:24 Put away from you a wayward mouth, And perverse lips put far from you.
4:25 Let your eyes look right on, And let your eyelids look straight before you.
4:26 Make level the path of your feet, And let all your ways be established.
4:27 Don't turn to the right hand nor to the left: Remove your foot from evil.
5:1 My son, attend to my wisdom; Incline your ear to my understanding:
5:2 That you may preserve discretion, And that your lips may keep knowledge.
5:3 For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil:
5:4 But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.
5:5 Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on Sheol;
5:6 If she does not find the level path of life: Her ways are unstable, [and] she will not know.
5:7 Now therefore, [my] sons, listen to me, And do not depart from the words of my mouth.
5:8 Remove your way far from her, And don't come near the door of her house;
5:9 Or else you will give your grandeur to others, And your years to the cruel;
5:10 Or else strangers will be filled with your strength, And your labors [be] in the house of an alien,
5:11 And you mourn at your latter end, When your flesh and your body are consumed,
5:12 And say, How I have hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;
5:13 Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!
5:14 I was well-near in all evil In the midst of the assembly and congregation.
5:15 Drink waters out of your own cistern, And running waters out of your own well.
5:16 Should your springs be dispersed abroad, And streams of water in the streets?
5:17 Let them be for yourself alone, And not for strangers with you.
5:18 Let your fountain be blessed; And rejoice in the wife of your youth.
5:19 [As] a loving hind and a pleasant doe, Let her nipples immerse you at all times; And be ravished always with her love.
5:20 For why should you, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
5:21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh; And he makes level all his paths.
5:22 His own iniquities will take the wicked, And he will be held with the cords of his sin.
5:23 He will die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.
6:1 My son, if you have become surety for your fellow man, If you have stricken your hands for a stranger;
6:2 You are snared with the words of your mouth, You are taken with the words of your mouth.
6:3 Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, Seeing you have come into the hand of your fellow man: Go, humble yourself, and importune your fellow man;
6:4 Don't give sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids;
6:5 Deliver yourself as a roe from the hand [of the hunter], And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
6:6 Go to the ant, you sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise:
6:7 Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,
6:8 Provides her bread in the summer, And gathers her food in the harvest.
6:9 How long will you sleep, O sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?
6:10 [Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:
6:11 So will your poverty come as a robber, And your want as an armed man.
6:12 [A] worthless man, a man of iniquity, Is he who walks with a perverse mouth;
6:13 Who winks with his eyes, who speaks with his feet, Who makes signs with his fingers;
6:14 In whose heart is perverseness, Who devises evil continually, Who sows discord.
6:15 Therefore will his calamity come suddenly; All of a sudden he will be broken, and that without remedy.
6:16 There are six things which Yahweh hates; Yes, seven which are disgusting to his soul:
6:17 Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;
6:18 A heart that devises wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,
6:19 A false witness who utters lies, And he who sows discord among brothers.
6:20 My son, keep the commandment of your father, And don't forsake the law of your mother:
6:21 Bind them continually on your heart; Tie them about your neck.
6:22 When you walk, it will lead you; When you sleep, it will watch over you; And when you awake, it will talk with you.
6:23 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is a light; And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
6:24 To keep you from the evil woman, From the flattery of the foreigner's tongue.
6:25 Don't lust after her beauty in your heart; Neither let her take you with her eyelids.
6:26 For on account of a prostitute [a man is brought] to a piece of bread; And the adulteress hunts for the precious soul.
6:27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?
6:28 Or can one walk on hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?
6:29 So he who goes in to his fellow man's wife; Whoever has any sex with her will not be unpunished.
6:30 Men do not despise a thief, if he steals To satisfy his soul when he is hungry:
6:31 But if he is found, he will restore sevenfold; He will give all the substance of his house.
6:32 He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding: He who does it destroys his own soul.
6:33 Wounds and dishonor he will get; And his reproach will not be wiped away.
6:34 For jealousy is the rage of a [noble] man; And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
6:35 He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.
7:1 My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with you.
7:2 Keep my commandments and live; And my law as the apple of your eye.
7:3 Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart.
7:4 Say to wisdom, You are my sister; And call understanding [your] kinswoman:
7:5 That they may keep you from the strange woman, From the foreigner who flatters with her words.
7:6 For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;
7:7 And I saw among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding,
7:8 Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house,
7:9 In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness.
7:10 And, look, there met him a woman With the attire of a prostitute, and wily of heart.
7:11 She is clamorous and willful; Her feet do not stay in her house:
7:12 Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lies in wait at every corner.
7:13 So she caught him, and kissed him, [And] with an impudent face she said to him:
7:14 Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me; This day I have paid my vows.
7:15 Therefore I came forth to meet you, Diligently to seek your face, and I have found you.
7:16 I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
7:17 I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
7:18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves.
7:19 For the man is not at home; He has gone on a long journey:
7:20 He has taken a bag of silver with him; He will come home at the full moon.
7:21 With her much fair speech she causes him to yield; With the flattering of her lips she forces him along.
7:22 He goes after her right away, As an ox goes to the slaughter, Or as [one in] fetters to the correction of the fool;
7:23 Until an arrow strikes through his liver; As a bird hurries to the snare, And does not know that it is for his soul.
7:24 Now therefore, [my] sons, listen to me, And attend to the words of my mouth.
7:25 Don't let your heart decline to her ways; Don't go astray in her paths.
7:26 For she has cast down many wounded: Yes, all her slain are a mighty host.
7:27 Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death.
8:1 Does not wisdom cry, And understanding put forth her voice?
8:2 On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she stands;
8:3 Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she cries aloud:
8:4 To you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, O men, I call; And my voice is to the sons of man.
8:5 O you<sup><small>+</small></sup> simple, understand prudence; And, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> fools, be of an understanding heart.
8:6 Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips will be right things.
8:7 For my mouth will utter truth; And wickedness is disgusting to my lips.
8:8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
8:9 They are all plain to him who understands, And right to those who find knowledge.
8:10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold.
8:11 For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
8:12 I, wisdom, stay with prudence, And find out knowledge [and] discretion.
8:13 The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, I hate.
8:14 Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might.
8:15 By me kings reign, And princes decree justice.
8:16 By me princes rule, And nobles, [even] all those who govern righteously.
8:17 I love those who love me; And those who seek me diligently will find me.
8:18 Riches and honor are with me; [Yes,] durable wealth and righteousness.
8:19 My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver.
8:20 I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice;
8:21 That I may cause those who love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries.
8:22 Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old.
8:23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was.
8:24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water.
8:25 Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills I was brought forth;
8:26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
8:27 When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle on the face of the deep,
8:28 When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong,
8:29 When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth;
8:30 Then I was by him, [as] a master craftsman; And I was daily [his] delight, Rejoicing always before him,
8:31 Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of man.
8:32 Now therefore, [my] sons, listen to me; For blessed are those who keep my ways.
8:33 Hear instruction, and be wise, And don't refuse it.
8:34 Blessed is [the] man who hears me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.
8:35 For whoever finds me finds life, And will obtain favor of Yahweh.
8:36 But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul: All those who hate me love death.
9:1 Wisdom has built her house; She has cut out her seven pillars:
9:2 She has killed her beasts; She has mingled her wine; She has also furnished her table:
9:3 She has sent forth her maidens; She cries on the highest places of the city:
9:4 Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,
9:5 Come, eat<sup><small>+</small></sup> of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled.
9:6 Leave off, you<sup><small>+</small></sup> simple ones, and live; And walk in the way of understanding.
9:7 He who corrects a scoffer gets to himself reviling; And he who reproves a wicked man [gets] himself a blot.
9:8 Don't reprove a scoffer, or else he will hate you: Reprove a wise man, and he will love you.
9:9 Give [instruction] to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
9:10 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom; And knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
9:11 For by me your days will be multiplied, And the years of your life will be increased.
9:12 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; And if you scoff, you alone will bear it.
9:13 The foolish woman is clamorous; [She is] simple, and knows nothing.
9:14 And she sits at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city,
9:15 To call to those who pass by, Who go right on their ways:
9:16 Whoever is simple, let him turn in here; And as for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,
9:17 Stolen waters are sweet, And bread [eaten] in secret is pleasant.
9:18 But he does not know that the spirits of the dead are there; That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
10:1 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a glad father; But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.
10:2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing; But righteousness delivers from death.
10:3 Yahweh will not allow the soul of the righteous to famish; But he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.
10:4 He becomes poor who works with a slack hand; But the hand of the diligent makes rich.
10:5 He who gathers in summer is a wise son; [But] he who sleeps in harvest is a son who causes shame.
10:6 Blessings are on the head of the righteous; But violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
10:7 The memory of the righteous is blessed; But the name of the wicked will rot.
10:8 The wise in heart will receive commandments; But a prating fool will fall.
10:9 He who walks uprightly walks surely; But he who perverts his ways will be known.
10:10 He who winks with the eye causes sorrow; But a prating fool will fall.
10:11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life; But violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
10:12 Hatred stirs up strifes; But love covers all transgressions.
10:13 In the lips of him who has discernment wisdom is found; But a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.
10:14 Wise men lay up knowledge; But the mouth of the foolish is a present destruction.
10:15 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: The destruction of the poor is their poverty.
10:16 The labor of the righteous, to life; The increase of the wicked, to sin.
10:17 He is in the way to life who heeds correction; But he who forsakes reproof errs.
10:18 He who hides hatred is of lying lips; And he who utters a slander is a fool.
10:19 In the multitude of words transgression does not cease; But he who refrains his lips does wisely.
10:20 The tongue of the righteous is [as] choice silver: The heart of the wicked is worth little.
10:21 The lips of the righteous feed many; But the foolish die for lack of understanding.
10:22 The blessing of Yahweh, it makes rich; And he adds no sorrow with it.
10:23 It is as sport to a fool to do wickedness; And [so is] wisdom to a man of understanding.
10:24 The fear of the wicked, it will come upon him; And the desire of the righteous will be granted.
10:25 When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more; But the righteous is an everlasting foundation.
10:26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, So is the sluggard to those who send him.
10:27 The fear of Yahweh prolongs days; But the years of the wicked will be shortened.
10:28 The hope of the righteous [will be] gladness; But the expectation of the wicked will perish.
10:29 The way of Yahweh is a stronghold to the upright; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
10:30 The righteous will never be removed; But the wicked will not stay in the land.
10:31 The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom; But the perverse tongue will be cut off.
10:32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable; But the mouth of the wicked [speaks] perverseness.
11:1 A false balance is disgusting to Yahweh; But a just weight is his delight.
11:2 When pride comes, then comes shame; But with the lowly is wisdom.
11:3 The integrity of the upright will guide them; But the perverseness of betrayers will destroy them.
11:4 Riches do not profit in the day of wrath; But righteousness delivers from death.
11:5 The righteousness of the perfect will direct his way; But the wicked will fall by his own wickedness.
11:6 The righteousness of the upright will deliver them; But betrayers will be taken in their own iniquity.
11:7 When [a] wicked man dies, [his] expectation will perish; And the hope of iniquity perishes.
11:8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, And the wicked comes in his stead.
11:9 With his mouth the godless man destroys his fellow man; But through knowledge the righteous will be delivered.
11:10 When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices; And when the wicked perish, there is shouting.
11:11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted; But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
11:12 He who despises his fellow man is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding holds his peace.
11:13 He who goes about as double-tongued reveals secrets;  But he who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter.
11:14 Where there is no wise guidance, a people falls; But in the multitude of counselors there is safety.
11:15 He who is surety for a stranger will smart for it; But he who hates suretyship is secure.
11:16 A gracious woman obtains honor; And violent men obtain riches.
11:17 The merciful man does good to his own soul; But he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.
11:18 The wicked earns deceitful wages; But he who sows righteousness [has] a sure reward.
11:19 He who is steadfast in righteousness, to life; And he who pursues evil, to his death.
11:20 Those who are perverse in heart are disgusting to Yahweh; But such as are perfect in [their] way are his delight.
11:21 [Though] hand [join] in hand, the evil man will not be unpunished; But the seed of the righteous will be delivered.
11:22 [As] a ring of gold in a swine's snout, [So is] a beautiful woman who is without discretion.
11:23 The desire of the righteous is only good; [But] the expectation of the wicked is wrath.
11:24 There is one who scatters, and increases yet more; And there is one who withholds more than is meet, but [tends] only to want.
11:25 The liberal soul will be made fat; And he who waters will be watered also himself.
11:26 He who withholds grain, the people will curse him; But blessing will be on the head of him who sells it.
11:27 He who diligently seeks good seeks favor; But he who searches after evil, it will come to him.
11:28 He who trusts in his riches will fall; But the righteous will flourish as the green leaf.
11:29 He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind; And the foolish will be slave to the wise of heart.
11:30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; And he who is wise wins souls.
11:31 Look, the righteous will be recompensed in the earth: How much more the wicked and the sinner!
12:1 Whoever loves correction loves knowledge; But he who hates reproof is brutish.
12:2 The good will obtain favor of Yahweh; But a man of wicked devices he will condemn.
12:3 Man will not be established by wickedness; But the root of the righteous will not be moved.
12:4 A worthy woman is the crown of her husband; But she who brings shame is as rottenness in his bones.
12:5 The thoughts of the righteous are just; [But] the counsels of the wicked are deceit.
12:6 The words of the wicked are of lying in wait for blood; But the mouth of the upright will deliver them.
12:7 The wicked are overthrown, and are not; But the house of the righteous will stand.
12:8 A man will be commended according to his wisdom; But he who is of a perverse heart will be despised.
12:9 Better is he who is lightly esteemed, and has a slave, Than he who honors himself, and lacks bread.
12:10 A righteous man regards the soul of his beast; But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.
12:11 He who tills his land will have plenty of bread; But he who follows after vanities is void of understanding.
12:12 The wicked desires the net of evil men; But the root of the righteous yields [fruit].
12:13 In the transgression of the lips is a snare to the evil man; But the righteous will come out of trouble.
12:14 A man will be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth; And the doings of man's hands will come back to him.
12:15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes; But he who is wise harkens to counsel.
12:16 A fool's vexation is presently known; But a prudent man conceals shame.
12:17 He who utters truth shows forth righteousness; But a false witness, deceit.
12:18 There is one who speaks rashly like the piercings of a sword; But the tongue of the wise is health.
12:19 The lip of truth will be established forever; But a lying tongue is but for a moment.
12:20 Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil; But to the counselors of peace is joy.
12:21 No mischief will happen to the righteous; But the wicked will be filled with evil.
12:22 Lying lips are disgusting to Yahweh; But those who deal truly are his delight.
12:23 [A] prudent man conceals knowledge; But the heart of fools proclaims foolishness.
12:24 The hand of the diligent will bear rule; But the slothful will be put under slave labor.
12:25 Heaviness in the heart of a man makes it stoop; But a good word makes it glad.
12:26 The righteous is a guide to his fellow man; But the way of the wicked causes them to err.
12:27 The slothful does not roast what he took in hunting; But the precious riches of man [is] diligence.
12:28 In the way of righteousness is life; And in its well-built road there is no death.
13:1 A wise son [hears] his father's instruction; But a scoffer does not hear rebuke.
13:2 A man will eat good by the fruit of his mouth; But the soul of betrayers [will eat] violence.
13:3 He who guards his mouth keeps his soul; [But] he who opens his lips wide will have destruction.
13:4 The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing; But the soul of the diligent will be made fat.
13:5 A righteous man hates lying; But a wicked man becomes a stench, and comes to shame.
13:6 Righteousness guards him who is upright in the way; But wickedness overthrows the sinner.
13:7 There is one who makes himself rich, yet has nothing: There is one who makes himself poor, yet has great wealth.
13:8 The ransom of a man's soul is his riches; But the poor hears no threatening.
13:9 The light of the righteous rejoices; But the lamp of the wicked will be put out.
13:10 By pride comes only contention; But with the well-advised is wisdom.
13:11 Wealth gotten by vanity will be diminished; But he who gathers by labor will have increase.
13:12 Hope deferred makes the heart sick; But when the desire comes, it is a tree of life.
13:13 Whoever despises the word brings destruction on himself; But he who fears the commandment will be rewarded.
13:14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, That one may avoid the snares of death.
13:15 Good understanding gives favor; But the way of betrayers is hard.
13:16 Every prudent man works with knowledge; But a fool flaunts [his] folly.
13:17 A wicked messenger will fall into evil; But a faithful ambassador is health.
13:18 Poverty and shame [will be to] him who refuses correction; But he who regards reproof will be honored.
13:19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul; But it is disgusting to fools to depart from evil.
13:20 Walk with wise men, and you will be wise; But the friend of fools will smart for it.
13:21 Evil pursues sinners; But the righteous will be recompensed with good.
13:22 A good man leaves an inheritance to the sons of his sons; And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous.
13:23 Much food [is in] the tillage of the poor; But there is that which is destroyed by reason of injustice.
13:24 He who spares his rod hates his son; But he who loves him chastens him diligently.
13:25 The righteous eats to the satisfying of his soul; But the belly of the wicked will want.
14:1 Every wise woman builds her house; But the foolish plucks it down with her own hands.
14:2 He who walks in his uprightness fears Yahweh; But he who is perverse in his ways despises him.
14:3 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod for [his] pride; But the lips of the wise will preserve them.
14:4 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean; But much increase is by the strength of the ox.
14:5 A faithful witness will not lie; But a false witness utters lies.
14:6 A scoffer seeks wisdom, and it is not [found]; But knowledge is easy to him who has understanding.
14:7 Go into the presence of a foolish man, And you will not perceive [in him] the lips of knowledge.
14:8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way; But the folly of fools is deceit.
14:9 A trespass-offering mocks fools; But among the upright there is goodwill.
14:10 The heart knows the bitterness of its soul; And a stranger does not intermeddle with its joy.
14:11 The house of the wicked will be overthrown; But the tent of the upright will flourish.
14:12 There is a way which seems right to a man; But its end are the ways of death.
14:13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; And the end of mirth is heaviness.
14:14 The backslider in heart will be filled with his own ways; And a good man [will be satisfied] from himself.
14:15 The simple believes every word; But the prudent man looks well to his going.
14:16 A wise man fears, and departs from evil; But the fool is furious and confident.
14:17 He who is soon angry will deal foolishly; And a man of wicked devices is hated.
14:18 The simple inherit folly; But the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
14:19 The evil bow down before the good; And the wicked, at the gates of the righteous.
14:20 The poor is hated even of his own fellow man; But the rich has many friends.
14:21 He who despises his fellow man sins; But he who has pity on the poor, he is happy.
14:22 Do they not err who devise evil? But mercy and truth [will be to] those who devise good.
14:23 In all labor there is profit; But the talk of the lips [tends] only to poverty.
14:24 The crown of the wise is their riches; [But] folly is the diadem of fools.
14:25 A true witness delivers souls; But he who utters lies [causes] deceit.
14:26 In the fear of Yahweh is strong confidence; And his sons will have a place of refuge.
14:27 The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life, That one may avoid the snares of death.
14:28 In the multitude of people is the king's glory; But in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.
14:29 He who is slow to anger is of great understanding; But he who is in a hurry of spirit exalts folly.
14:30 A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh; But envy is the rottenness of the bones.
14:31 He who oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker; But he who has mercy on the needy honors him.
14:32 The wicked is thrust down in his evildoing; But the righteous has a refuge in his death.
14:33 Wisdom rests in the heart of him who has understanding; But [that which is] in the inward part of fools is made known.
14:34 Righteousness exalts a nation; But sin is a reproach to any people.
14:35 The king's favor is toward a slave who deals wisely; But his wrath will be [against] him who causes shame.
15:1 A soft answer turns away wrath; But a grievous word stirs up anger.
15:2 The tongue of the wise utters knowledge aright; But the mouth of fools gushes out folly.
15:3 The eyes of Yahweh are in every place, Keeping watch on the evil and the good.
15:4 A gentle tongue is a tree of life; But perverseness in it is a breaking of the spirit.
15:5 A fool despises his father's correction; But he who regards reproof gets prudence.
15:6 In the house of the righteous is much treasure; But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.
15:7 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge; But the heart of the foolish is not so.
15:8 The sacrifice of the wicked is disgusting to Yahweh; But the prayer of the upright is his delight.
15:9 The way of the wicked is disgusting to Yahweh; But he loves him who follows after righteousness.
15:10 There is grievous correction for him who forsakes the way; [And] he who hates reproof will die.
15:11 Sheol and Abaddon are before Yahweh: How much more then the hearts of the sons of man!
15:12 A scoffer does not love to be reproved; He will not go to the wise.
15:13 A glad heart makes a cheerful countenance; But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.
15:14 The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge; But the mouth of fools feeds on folly.
15:15 All the days of the afflicted are evil; But he who is of a cheerful heart [has] a continual feast.
15:16 Better is little, with the fear of Yahweh, Than great treasure and turmoil with it.
15:17 Better is a dinner of herbs, where there is love, Than a stalled ox and hatred with it.
15:18 A wrathful man stirs up contention; But he who is slow to anger appeases strife.
15:19 The way of the sluggard is as a hedge of thorns; But the path of the upright is made a highway.
15:20 A wise son makes a glad father; But [a] foolish man despises his mother.
15:21 Folly is joy to him who is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding makes straight his going.
15:22 Where there is no counsel, purposes are disappointed; But in the multitude of counselors they are established.
15:23 A man has joy in the answer of his mouth; And a word in due season, how good it is!
15:24 To the wise the way of life [goes] upward, That he may depart from Sheol beneath.
15:25 Yahweh will root up the house of the proud; But he will establish the border of the widow.
15:26 Evil devices are disgusting to Yahweh; But pleasant words [are] pure.
15:27 He who is greedy of gain troubles his own house; But he who hates bribes will live.
15:28 The heart of the righteous studies to answer; But the mouth of the wicked gushes out evil things.
15:29 Yahweh is far from the wicked; But he hears the prayer of the righteous.
15:30 The light of the eyes rejoices the heart; [And] good news make the bones fat.
15:31 The ear that harkens to the reproof of life Will reside among the wise.
15:32 He who refuses correction despises his own soul; But he who harkens to reproof gets understanding.
15:33 The fear of Yahweh is the instruction of wisdom; And before honor [goes] humility.
16:1 The plans of the heart belong to man; But the answer of the tongue is from Yahweh.
16:2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; But Yahweh weighs the spirits.
16:3 Commit your works to Yahweh, And your purposes will be established.
16:4 Yahweh has made everything for its own end; Yes, even the wicked for the day of evil.
16:5 Everyone who is proud in heart is disgusting to Yahweh: [Though] hand [join] in hand, he will not be unpunished.
16:6 By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for; And by the fear of Yahweh men depart from evil.
16:7 When a man's ways please Yahweh, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
16:8 Better is a little, with righteousness, Than great revenues with injustice.
16:9 The heart of man devises his way; But Yahweh directs his steps.
16:10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king; His mouth will not transgress in judgment.
16:11 A just balance and scales are Yahweh's; All the weights of the bag are his work.
16:12 It is disgusting to kings to commit wickedness; For the throne is established by righteousness.
16:13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; And they love him who speaks right.
16:14 The wrath of a king is [as] messengers of death; But a wise man will pacify it.
16:15 In the light of the king's countenance is life; And his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain.
16:16 How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! Yes, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver.
16:17 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: He who keeps his way preserves his soul.
16:18 Pride [goes] before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall.
16:19 It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, Than to divide the spoil with the proud.
16:20 He who gives heed to the word will find good; And whoever trusts in Yahweh, he is happy.
16:21 The wise in heart will be called prudent; And the sweetness of the lips increases learning.
16:22 Understanding is a wellspring of life to him who has it; But the correction of fools is [their] folly.
16:23 The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, And adds learning to his lips.
16:24 Pleasant words are [as] a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
16:25 There is a way which seems right to a man, But its end are the ways of death.
16:26 The soul of the laboring man labors for him; For his mouth urges him [thereto].
16:27 A worthless man devises mischief; And in his lips there is as a scorching fire.
16:28 A perverse man scatters abroad strife; And a whisperer separates best friends.
16:29 A man of violence entices his fellow man, And leads him in a way that is not good.
16:30 He who shuts his eyes, [it is] to devise perverse things: He who compresses his lips brings evil to pass.
16:31 The gray head is a crown of glory; It will be found in the way of righteousness.
16:32 He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; And he who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.
16:33 The lot is cast into the lap; But the whole disposing of it is of Yahweh.
17:1 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness with it, Than a house full of feasting with strife.
17:2 A slave who deals wisely will have rule over a son who causes shame, And will have part in the inheritance among the brothers.
17:3 The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; But Yahweh tries the hearts.
17:4 An evildoer gives heed to wicked lips; [And] a liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.
17:5 Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker; [And] he who is glad at calamity will not be unpunished.
17:6 Sons of sons are the crown of old men; And the glory of sons are their fathers.
17:7 Excellent speech does not become a fool; Much less do lying lips a prince.
17:8 A bribe is [as] a precious stone in the eyes of him who has it; Wherever it turns, it prospers.
17:9 He who covers a transgression seeks love; But he who harps on a matter separates best friends.
17:10 A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding Than a hundred stripes into a fool.
17:11 An evil man seeks only rebellion; Therefore a cruel messenger will be sent against him.
17:12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, Rather than a fool in his folly.
17:13 Whoever rewards evil for good, Evil will not depart from his house.
17:14 The beginning of strife is [as] when one lets out water: Therefore leave off contention, before there is quarrelling.
17:15 He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, Both of them alike are disgusting to Yahweh.
17:16 Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, Seeing he has no understanding?
17:17 A companion loves at all times; And a brother is born for adversity.
17:18 [A] man void of understanding strikes hands, And becomes surety in the presence of his fellow man.
17:19 He who loves transgression loves strife: He who raises his gate high seeks destruction.
17:20 He who has a wayward heart finds no good; And he who has a perverse tongue falls into mischief.
17:21 He who begets a fool [does it] to his sorrow; And the father of a fool has no joy.
17:22 A cheerful heart is a good medicine; But a broken spirit dries up the bones.
17:23 A wicked man receives a bribe out of the bosom, To pervert the ways of justice.
17:24 Wisdom is before the face of him who has understanding; But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.
17:25 A foolish son is a grief to his father, And bitterness to her who bore him.
17:26 Also to punish the righteous is not good, [Nor] to strike the noble for [their] uprightness.
17:27 He who spares his words has knowledge; And he who is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding.
17:28 Even a fool, when he holds his peace, is counted wise; When he shuts his lips, he is [esteemed as] prudent.
18:1 He who separates himself seeks [his own] desire, And rages against all sound wisdom.
18:2 A fool has no delight in understanding, But only that his heart may reveal itself.
18:3 When the wicked comes, there comes also contempt, And with ignominy [comes] reproach.
18:4 The words of a man's mouth are [as] deep waters; The wellspring of wisdom is [as] a gushing brook.
18:5 To respect the person of the wicked is not good, [Nor] to turn aside the righteous in judgment.
18:6 A fool's lips enter into contention, And his mouth calls for stripes.
18:7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, And his lips are the snare of his soul.
18:8 The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts.
18:9 He also who is slack in his work Is brother to him who is a destroyer.
18:10 The name of Yahweh is a strong tower; The righteous runs into it, and is safe.
18:11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, And as a high wall in his own imagination.
18:12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty; And before honor [goes] humility.
18:13 He who gives answer before he hears, It is folly and shame to him.
18:14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; But a broken spirit who can bear?
18:15 The heart of the prudent gets knowledge; And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
18:16 A gift of man makes room for him, And brings him before great men.
18:17 He who pleads his cause first [seems] just; But his fellow man comes and searches him out.
18:18 The lot causes contentions to cease, And parts between the mighty.
18:19 A brother offended [is harder to be won] than a strong city; And [such] contentions are like the bars of a castle.
18:20 A man's belly will be filled with the fruit of his mouth; With the increase of his lips he will be satisfied.
18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue; And those who love it will eat its fruit.
18:22 Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, And obtains favor of Yahweh.
18:23 The poor uses entreaties; But the rich answers roughly.
18:24 He who has many companions [does it] to his own destruction; But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
19:1 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity Than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.
19:2 Also, without knowledge the soul is not good; And he who hurries with his feet sins.
19:3 The foolishness of man subverts his way; And his heart frets against Yahweh.
19:4 Wealth adds many companions; But the poor is separated from his companion.
19:5 A false witness will not be unpunished; And he who utters lies will not escape.
19:6 Many will entreat the favor of the liberal man; And every man is a companion to him who gives gifts.
19:7 All the brothers of the poor hate him: How much more do his friends go far from him! He pursues [them with] words, [but] they are gone.
19:8 He who gets wisdom loves his own soul: He who keeps understanding will find good.
19:9 A false witness will not be unpunished; And he who utters lies will perish.
19:10 Delicate living is not seemly for a fool; Much less for a slave to have rule over princes.
19:11 The discretion of man makes him slow to anger; And it is his glory to pass over a transgression.
19:12 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; But his favor is as dew on the grass.
19:13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father; And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.
19:14 House and riches are an inheritance from fathers; But a prudent wife is from Yahweh.
19:15 Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep; And the idle soul will suffer hunger.
19:16 He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul; [But] he who is careless of his ways will die.
19:17 He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh, And his good deed he will pay him again.
19:18 Chasten your son, seeing there is hope; And don't set your soul on his destruction.
19:19 A man of great wrath will bear the penalty; For if you deliver [him], you must do it yet again.
19:20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, That you may be wise in your latter end.
19:21 There are many devices in a man's heart; But the counsel of Yahweh, that will stand.
19:22 That which makes man to be desired is his kindness; And a poor man is better than a liar.
19:23 The fear of Yahweh, [leads] to life And he [who has it] will reside satisfied; He will not be visited with evil. 
19:24 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish, And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
19:25 Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; And reprove one who has understanding, [and] he will understand knowledge.
19:26 He who does violence to his father, and chases away his mother, Is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.
19:27 Cease, my son, to hear instruction [Only] to err from the words of knowledge.
19:28 A worthless witness mocks at justice; And the mouth of the wicked swallows iniquity.
19:29 Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And stripes for the back of fools.
20:1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; And whoever errs by it is not wise.
20:2 The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion: He who makes him furious sins [against] his own soul.
20:3 It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife; But every fool will be quarrelling.
20:4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; Therefore he will beg in harvest, and have nothing.
20:5 Counsel in the heart of man is [like] deep water; But a man of understanding will draw it out.
20:6 Most of man will proclaim every one his own kindness; But a faithful man who can find?
20:7 A righteous man who walks in his integrity, Blessed are his sons after him.
20:8 A king who sits on the throne of judgment Scatters away all evil with his eyes.
20:9 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?
20:10 Diverse weights, and diverse measures, Both of them alike are disgusting to Yahweh.
20:11 Even a child makes himself known by his doings, Whether his work is pure, and whether it is right.
20:12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Yahweh has made even both of them.
20:13 Do not love sleep, or else you will come to poverty; Open your eyes, [and] you will be satisfied with bread.
20:14 It is bad, it is bad, says the buyer; But when he has gone his way, then he boasts.
20:15 There is gold, and abundance of rubies; But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
20:16 Take his garment who is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge [who is surety] for foreigners.
20:17 Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; But afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel.
20:18 Every purpose is established by counsel; And by wise guidance make war.
20:19 He who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets; Therefore don't company with him who opens his lips wide.
20:20 Whoever curses his father or his mother, His lamp will be put out in the middle of the night.
20:21 An inheritance [may be] obtained hastily at the beginning; But its end will not be blessed.
20:22 Don't say, I will recompense evil: Wait for Yahweh, and he will save you.
20:23 Diverse weights are disgusting to Yahweh; And a false balance is not good.
20:24 A man's goings are of Yahweh; How then can [noble] man understand his way?
20:25 It is a snare to man to rashly say, [It is] holy, And after vows to make inquiry.
20:26 A wise king winnows the wicked, And brings the [threshing]-wheel over them.
20:27 The breath of man is the lamp of Yahweh, Searching all his innermost parts.
20:28 Kindness and truth preserve the king; And his throne is upheld by kindness.
20:29 The glory of young men is their strength; And the majesty of old men is the gray head.
20:30 Stripes that wound cleanse away evil; And strokes [reach] the innermost parts.
21:1 The king's heart is in the hand of Yahweh as the watercourses: He turns it wherever he will.
21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes; But Yahweh weighs the hearts.
21:3 To do righteousness and justice Is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice.
21:4 A high look, and a proud heart, [Even] the lamp of the wicked, is sin.
21:6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue Is a vapor driven to and fro by those who seek death.
21:7 The violence of the wicked will sweep them away, Because they refuse to do justice.
21:8 The way of him who is laden with guilt is exceedingly crooked; But as for the pure, his work is right.
21:9 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, Than with a contentious woman in a wide house.
21:10 The soul of the wicked desires evil: His fellow man finds no favor in his eyes.
21:11 When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise; And when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.
21:12 The righteous man considers the house of the wicked, [How] the wicked are overthrown to [their] ruin.
21:13 Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, He also will cry, but will not be heard.
21:14 A gift in secret pacifies anger; And a present in the bosom, strong wrath.
21:15 It is joy to the righteous to do justice; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
21:16 [The] man who wanders out of the way of understanding Will rest in the assembly of the spirits of the dead.
21:17 He who loves pleasure will be a poor man: He who loves wine and oil will not be rich.
21:18 The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; And the betrayer [comes] in the stead of the upright.
21:19 It is better to dwell in a desert land, Than with a contentious and fretful woman.
21:20 There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; But [a] foolish man swallows it up.
21:21 He who follows after righteousness and kindness Finds life, righteousness, and honor.
21:22 A wise man scales the city of the mighty, And brings down the strength of its confidence.
21:23 Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue Keeps his soul from troubles.
21:24 The proud and haughty man, scoffer is his name; He works in the arrogance of pride.
21:25 The desire of the sluggard kills him; For his hands refuse to labor.
21:26 There is one who covets greedily all the day long; But the righteous gives and does not withhold.
21:27 The sacrifice of the wicked is disgusting: How much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind!
21:28 A false witness will perish; But the man who hears will speak so as to endure.
21:29 A wicked man hardens his face; But as for the upright, he establishes his ways.
21:30 There is no wisdom nor understanding Nor counsel against Yahweh.
21:31 The horse is prepared against the day of battle; But victory is of Yahweh.
22:1 A [good] name is rather to be chosen than great riches, [And] loving favor rather than silver and gold.
22:2 The rich and the poor meet together: Yahweh is the maker of them all.
22:3 A prudent man sees the evil, and hides himself; But the simple pass on, and suffer for it.
22:4 The reward of humility [and] the fear of Yahweh [Is] riches, and honor, and life.
22:5 Thorns [and] snares are in the way of the perverse: He who keeps his soul will be far from them.
22:7 The rich rules over the poor; And the borrower is slave to the lender.
22:8 He who sows iniquity will reap calamity; And the rod of his wrath will fail.
22:9 He who has a bountiful eye will be blessed; For he gives of his bread to the poor.
22:10 Cast out the scoffer, and contention will go out; Yes, strife and ignominy will cease.
22:11 He who loves pureness of heart, [For] the grace of his lips the king will be his companion.
22:12 The eyes of Yahweh preserve [him who has] knowledge; But he overthrows the words of the betrayer.
22:13 The sluggard says, There is a lion outside: I will be slain in the streets.
22:14 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: He who is abhorred of Yahweh will fall in it.
22:15 Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; [But] the rod of correction will drive it far from him.
22:16 He who oppresses the poor to increase his [gain], [And] he who gives to the rich, [will come] only to want.
22:17 Words of the Wise. Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise, And apply your heart to my knowledge.
22:18 For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them inside you, If they are established together on your lips.
22:19 That your trust may be in Yahweh, I have made [them] known to you this day, even to you.
22:20 Have I not written to you excellent things Of counsels and knowledge,
22:21 To make you know the certainty of the words of truth, That you may carry back words of truth to those who send you?
22:22 Don't rob the poor, because he is poor; Neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:
22:23 For Yahweh will plead their cause, And despoil of soul those who despoil them.
22:24 Make no friendship with a man who is given to anger; And with a wrathful man you will not go:
22:25 Or else you will learn his ways, And get a snare to your soul.
22:26 Don't be one of those who strikes hands, [Or] of those who are sureties for debts.
22:27 If you have not with which to pay, Why should he take away your bed from under you?
22:28 Don't remove the ancient landmark, Which your fathers have set.
22:29 Do you see a man diligent in his business? He will stand before kings; He will not stand before mean men.
23:1 When you sit to eat with a ruler, Consider diligently him who is before you;
23:2 And put a knife to your throat, If you are a man who is given to soul.
23:3 Don't be desirous of his dainties; Seeing they are deceitful food.
23:4 Don't weary yourself to be rich; Cease from your own wisdom.
23:5 Will you set your eyes on that which is not? For [riches] certainly make themselves wings, Like an eagle that flies toward heaven.
23:6 Don't eat the bread of him who has an evil eye, Neither desire his dainties:
23:7 For as he thinks in his soul, so he is: Eat and drink, he says to you; But his heart is not with you.
23:8 The morsel which you have eaten you will vomit up, And lose your sweet words.
23:9 Don't speak in the hearing of a fool; For he will despise the wisdom of your words.
23:10 Don't remove the ancient landmark; And don't enter into the fields of the fatherless:
23:11 For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause against you.
23:12 Apply your heart to instruction, And your ears to the words of knowledge.
23:13 Do not withhold correction from the child; [For] if you beat him with the rod, he will not die.
23:14 You will beat him with the rod, And will deliver his soul from Sheol.
23:15 My son, if your heart be wise, My heart will be glad, even mine:
23:16 Yes, my heart will rejoice, When your lips speak right things.
23:17 Don't let your heart envy sinners; But [be] in the fear of Yahweh all the day long:
23:18 For surely there is a reward; And your hope will not be cut off.
23:19 Hear, my son, and be wise, And guide your heart in the way.
23:20 Don't be among winebibbers, Among gluttonous eaters of flesh:
23:21 For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty; And drowsiness will clothe [a man] with rags.
23:22 Listen to your father who begot you, And don't despise your mother when she is old.
23:23 Buy the truth, and don't sell it; [Yes,] wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
23:24 The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; And he who begets a wise child will have joy of him.
23:25 Let your father and your mother be glad, And let her who bore you rejoice.
23:26 My son, give me your heart; And let your eyes delight in my ways.
23:27 For a prostitute is a deep ditch; And a foreign woman is a narrow pit.
23:28 Yes, she lies in wait as a robber, And increases the betrayers among man.
23:29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?
23:30 Those who tarry long at the wine; Those who go to seek out mixed wine.
23:31 Don't look on the wine when it is red, When it sparkles in the cup, When it goes down smoothly:
23:32 At the last it bites like a serpent, And stings like an adder.
23:33 Your eyes will see strange things, And your heart will utter perverse things.
23:34 Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea, Or as he who lies on the top of a mast.
23:35 They have stricken me, [you will say], and I was not hurt; They have beaten me, and I did not feel it: When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
24:1 Don't be envious against evil men; Neither desire to be with them:
24:2 For their heart studies oppression, And their lips talk of mischief.
24:3 Through wisdom is a house built; And by understanding it is established;
24:4 And by knowledge are the chambers filled With all precious and pleasant riches.
24:5 A wise [noble] man is strong; Yes, a man of knowledge increases might
24:6 For by wise guidance you will make your war; And in the multitude of counselors there is safety.
24:7 Wisdom is too high for a fool: He does not open his mouth in the gate.
24:8 He who devises to do evil, Men will call him a mischief-maker.
24:9 The thought of foolishness is sin; And the scoffer is disgusting to man.
24:10 If you faint in the day of adversity, Your strength is small.
24:11 Deliver those who are carried away to death, And see that you hold back those who are ready to be slain.
24:12 If you say, Look, we did not know this; Does not he who weighs the hearts consider it? And he who keeps your soul, does he not know it? And will he not render to man according to his work?
24:13 My son, eat honey, for it is good; And the drippings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:
24:14 So you will know wisdom to be to your soul; If you have found it, then there will be a reward, And your hope will not be cut off.
24:15 Don't lay in wait, O wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous; Don't destroy his resting-place:
24:16 For a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again; But the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
24:17 Don't rejoice when your enemy falls, And don't let your heart be glad when he is overthrown;
24:18 Or else Yahweh will see it, and it will be evil in his eyes, And he will turn away his wrath from him.
24:19 Don't fret yourself because of evildoers; Neither be envious at the wicked:
24:20 For there will be no reward to the evil man; The lamp of the wicked will be put out.
24:21 My son, fear Yahweh and the king; [And] don't company with those who are given to change:
24:22 For their calamity will rise suddenly; And the destruction from them both, who knows it?
24:23 These also are [words] of the wise. To show favoritism in judgment is not good.
24:24 He who says to the wicked, You are righteous; Peoples will curse him, nations will abhor him:
24:25 But to those who rebuke [him] will be delight, And a good blessing will come upon them.
24:26 He kisses the lips Who gives a right answer.
24:27 Prepare your work outside, And make it ready for yourself in the field; And afterward build your house.
24:28 Don't be a witness against your fellow man without cause; And do not deceive with your lips.
24:29 Don't say, I will do so to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work.
24:30 I went by the field of the sluggard, And by the vineyard of [the] man void of understanding;
24:31 And, look, it was all grown over with thorns, The face of it was covered with nettles, And the stone wall of it was broken down.
24:32 Then I looked, and considered well; I saw, and received instruction:
24:33 [Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep;
24:34 So will your poverty come as a robber, And your want as an armed man.
25:1 These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
25:2 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.
25:3 As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, So the heart of kings is unsearchable.
25:4 Take away the dross from the silver, And there comes forth a vessel for the refiner:
25:5 Take away the wicked [from] before the king, And his throne will be established in righteousness.
25:6 Don't put yourself forward in the presence of the king, And don't stand in the place of great men:
25:7 For it is better that it is said to you, Come up here, Than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince, Whom your eyes have seen.
25:8 Don't hastily bring [it] to court, Or else what will you do in its end, When your fellow man has put you to shame.
25:9 Debate your cause with your fellow man [himself], And don't disclose the secret of another;
25:10 Or else he who hears it will revile you, And your infamy will not turn away.
25:11 A word fitly spoken Is [like] apples of gold in network of silver.
25:12 [As] an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, [So is] a wise reprover on an obedient ear.
25:13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, [So is] a faithful messenger to those who send him; For he refreshes the soul of his masters.
25:14 [As] clouds and wind without rain, [So is] he who boasts himself of his gifts falsely.
25:15 By long forbearing is a ruler persuaded, And a soft tongue breaks the bone.
25:16 Have you found honey? Eat so much as is sufficient for you, Or else you will be filled with it, and vomit it.
25:17 Let your foot be seldom in your fellow man's house, Or else he will be weary of you, and hate you.
25:18 A man who bears false witness against his fellow man Is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
25:19 Confidence in a betrayer in time of trouble Is [like] a crumbling tooth, and an unsteady foot.
25:20 [As] vinegar on lye, and [as] smoke for the eyes, So is he who sings songs to a heavy heart.
25:21 If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink:
25:22 For you will heap coals of fire on his head, And Yahweh will reward you.
25:23 The north wind brings forth rain: So does a backbiting tongue an angry countenance.
25:24 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, Than with a contentious woman in a wide house.
25:25 [As] cold waters to a thirsty soul, So is good news from a far country.
25:26 [As] a troubled fountain, and a corrupted spring, [So is] a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.
25:27 It is not good to eat much honey: And searching out their glory is glory.
25:28 He whose spirit is without restraint Is [like] a city that is broken down and without walls.
26:1 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honor is not seemly for a fool.
26:2 As the sparrow in her wandering, as the swallow in her flying, So the curse that is causeless does not come.
26:3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, And a rod for the back of fools.
26:4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly, Or else you will also be like him.
26:5 Answer a fool according to his folly, Or else he will be wise in his own eyes.
26:6 He who sends a message by the hand of a fool Cuts off [his own] feet, [and] drinks crime.
26:7 [As] the legs hang loose from a cripple: So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
26:8 As one who binds a stone in a sling, So is he who gives honor to a fool.
26:9 [As] a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard, So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
26:10 [As] an archer that wounds all, So is he who hires a fool and he who hires those who pass by.
26:11 As a dog that returns to his vomit, [So is] a fool that repeats his folly.
26:12 Do you see a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of him.
26:13 The sluggard says, There is a lion in the way; A lion is in the streets.
26:14 [As] the door turns on its hinges, So does the sluggard on his bed.
26:15 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; It wearies him to bring it again to his mouth.
26:16 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit Than seven men who can render a reason.
26:17 He who passes by, [and] is furious with strife not belonging to him, Is [like] one who takes a dog by the ears.
26:18 As a lunatic who casts firebrands, Arrows, and death,
26:19 So is the man who deceives his fellow man, And says, Am I not joking?
26:20 For lack of wood the fire goes out; And where there is no whisperer, contention ceases.
26:21 [As] coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, So is a contentious man to inflame strife.
26:22 The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts.
26:23 Fervent lips and a wicked heart Are [like] an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross.
26:24 He who hates dissembles with his lips; But he lays up deceit inside him:
26:25 When he speaks fair, don't believe him; For there are seven disgusting things in his heart:
26:26 Though [his] hatred covers itself with guile, His wickedness will be openly shown before the assembly.
26:27 Whoever digs a pit will fall in it; And he who rolls a stone, it will return on him.
26:28 A lying tongue hates those whom it has wounded; And a flattering mouth works ruin.
27:1 Don't boast yourself of tomorrow; For you don't know what a day may bring forth.
27:2 Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; A stranger, and not your own lips.
27:3 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; But a fool's vexation is heavier than both of them.
27:4 Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; But who is able to stand before jealousy?
27:5 Better is open rebuke Than love that is hidden.
27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; But the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
27:7 The full soul loathes a honeycomb; But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
27:8 As a bird that wanders from her nest, So is a man who wanders from his place.
27:9 Oil and perfume rejoice the heart; So does the sweetness of a man's companion [that comes] from the counsel of the soul.
27:10 Your own companion, and your father's companion, do not forsake; And don't go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity: Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother far off.
27:11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, That I may answer him who reproaches me.
27:12 A prudent man sees the evil, [and] hides himself; [But] the simple pass on, [and] suffer for it.
27:13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge [who is surety] for a foreign woman.
27:14 He who blesses his fellow man with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, It will be counted a curse to him.
27:15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day And a contentious woman are alike:
27:16 He who would restrain her restrains the wind; And his right hand encounters oil.
27:17 Iron sharpens iron; So a man sharpens the countenance of his fellow man.
27:18 Whoever keeps the fig tree will eat its fruit; And he who regards his master will be honored.
27:19 As in water face [answers] to face, So the heart of man to man.
27:20 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; And the eyes of man are never satisfied.
27:21 The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; And a man is [tried] by his praise.
27:22 Though you should bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with bruised grain, Yet his foolishness will not depart from him.
27:23 Be diligent to know the state of your flocks, [And] look well to your herds:
27:24 For riches are not forever: And does the crown endure to all generations?
27:25 The hay is carried, and the tender grass shows itself, And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in.
27:26 The lambs are for your clothing, And the goats are the price of the field;
27:27 And [there will be] goats' milk enough for your food, for the food of your household, And maintenance for your maidens.
28:1 The wicked flee when no man pursues; But the righteous are bold as a lion.
28:2 For the transgression of a land many are its princes; But by [a] man of understanding [and] knowledge the state [of it] will be prolonged.
28:3 A needy [noble] man who oppresses the poor Is [like] a sweeping rain which leaves no food.
28:4 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked; But such as keep the law contend with them.
28:5 Evil men don't understand justice; But those who seek Yahweh understand all things.
28:6 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, Than he who is perverse in [his] ways, though he is rich.
28:7 Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; But he who is a shepherd of gluttons shames his father.
28:8 He who augments his substance by interest and increase, Gathers it for him who has pity on the poor.
28:9 He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is disgusting.
28:10 Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, He will fall into his own pit; But the perfect will inherit good.
28:11 The rich man is wise in his own eyes; But the poor who has understanding searches him out.
28:12 When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; But when the wicked rise, man will hide.
28:13 He who covers his transgressions will not prosper: But whoever confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.
28:14 Happy is [the] man who fears always; But he who hardens his heart will fall into mischief.
28:15 [As] a roaring lion, and a ranging bear, [So is] a wicked ruler over a poor people.
28:16 The leader who lacks understanding is also a great oppressor; [But] he who hates covetousness will prolong his days.
28:17 [A] man who is laden with the blood of a soul Will flee to the pit; let no man uphold him.
28:18 Whoever walks uprightly will be delivered; But he who is perverse in [his] ways will fall at once.
28:19 He who tills his land will have plenty of bread; But he who follows after vanities will have poverty enough.
28:20 A faithful man will abound with blessings; But he who hurries to be rich will not be unpunished.
28:21 To show favoritism is not good; Neither that a [noble] man should transgress for a piece of bread.
28:22 He who has an evil eye hurries after riches, And does not know that want will come upon him.
28:23 He who rebukes man will afterward find more favor Than he who flatters with the tongue.
28:24 Whoever robs his father or his mother, and says, It is no transgression, The same is the partner of a destroyer.
28:25 A greedy soul stirs up strife; But he who puts his trust in Yahweh will be made fat.
28:26 He who trusts in his own heart is a fool; But whoever walks wisely, he will be delivered.
28:27 He who gives to the poor will not lack; But he who hides his eyes will have many a curse.
28:28 When the wicked rise, man hides himself; But when they perish, the righteous increase.
29:1 He who being often reproved hardens his neck Will suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.
29:2 When the righteous have increased, the people rejoice; But when a wicked man bears rule, the people sigh.
29:3 Whoever loves wisdom rejoices his father; But he who is a shepherd of prostitutes wastes [his] substance.
29:4 The king by justice establishes the land; But he who exacts gifts overthrows it.
29:5 A [noble] man who flatters his fellow man Spreads a net for his steps.
29:6 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare; But the righteous sings and rejoices.
29:7 The righteous takes knowledge of the cause of the poor; The wicked does not have understanding to know [it].
29:8 Scoffers set a city in a flame; But wise men turn away wrath.
29:9 If a wise man has a controversy with a foolish man, Whether he is angry or laughs, there will be no rest.
29:10 The bloodthirsty hate him who is perfect; And as for the upright, they seek his soul.
29:11 A fool utters all his anger; But a wise man keeps it back and stills it.
29:12 If a ruler harkens to falsehood, All his ministers are wicked.
29:13 The poor man and the oppressor meet together; Yahweh lightens the eyes of them both.
29:14 The king who faithfully judges the poor, His throne will be established forever.
29:15 The rod and reproof give wisdom; But a child left to himself causes shame to his mother.
29:16 When the wicked are increased, transgression increases; But the righteous will look at their fall.
29:17 Correct your son, and he will give you rest; Yes, he will give delight to your soul.
29:18 Where there is no vision, the people go wild; But he who keeps the law, he is happy.
29:19 A slave will not be corrected by words; For though he understands, he will not give heed.
29:20 Do you see a man who is in a hurry in his words? There is more hope of a fool than of him.
29:21 He who delicately brings up his slave from a child Will have him become a son at the last.
29:22 An angry man stirs up strife, And a wrathful man abounds in transgression.
29:23 The pride of man will bring him low; But he who is of a lowly spirit will obtain honor.
29:24 Whoever shares with a thief hates his own soul; He hears the adjuration and utters nothing.
29:25 The fear of man brings a snare; But whoever puts his trust in Yahweh will be safe.
29:26 Many seek the ruler's favor; But a man's judgment [comes] from Yahweh.
29:27 An unjust man is disgusting to the righteous; And he who is upright in the way is disgusting to the wicked.
30:1 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; The oracle. The [noble] man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
30:2 Surely I am more brutish than any man, And don't have the understanding of man;
30:3 And I have not learned wisdom, Neither have I knowledge of the Holy One.
30:4 Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has bound the waters in his garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name, if you know?
30:5 Every word of God is tried: He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
30:6 Don't add to his words, Or else he will reprove you, and you will be found a liar.
30:7 Two things I have asked of you; Don't deny me [them] before I die:
30:8 Remove far from me falsehood and lies; Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with the food that is needful for me:
30:9 Or else I will be full, and deny [you], and say, Who is Yahweh? Or else I will be poor, and steal, And profanely use the name of my God.
30:10 Don't slander a slave to his master, Or else he will curse you, and you will be held guilty.
30:11 There is a generation who curse their father, And do not bless their mother.
30:12 There is a generation who are pure in their own eyes, And [yet] are not washed from their filthiness.
30:13 There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! And their eyelids are lifted up.
30:14 There is a generation whose teeth are [as] swords, and their jaw teeth [as] knives, To devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among man.
30:15 The horseleach has two daughters, [crying] Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, [Yes,] four that don't say, Enough:
30:16 Sheol; and the barren womb; The earth that is not satisfied with water; And the fire that does not say, Enough.
30:17 The eye that mocks at his father, And despises to obey his mother, The ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it.
30:18 There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Yes, four which I don't know:
30:19 The way of an eagle in the air; The way of a serpent on a rock; The way of a ship in the midst of the sea; And the way of a [noble] man with a young woman.
30:20 So is the way of an adulterous woman; She eats, and wipes her mouth, And says, I have done no wickedness.
30:21 For three things the earth trembles, And for four, [which] it can't bear:
30:22 For a slave when he is king; And a fool when he is filled with food;
30:23 For an odious woman when she is married; And a female slave when she takes the place of her mistress.
30:24 There are four things which are little on the earth, But they are exceedingly wise:
30:25 The ants are not a strong people, Yet they provide their food in the summer;
30:26 The conies are but a feeble folk, Yet make they their houses in the rocks;
30:27 The locusts have no king, Yet go they forth all of them by bands;
30:28 The lizard, you can catch it with [your] hands, Yet she is in kings' palaces.
30:29 There are three things which are stately in their march, Yes, four which are stately in going:
30:30 The lion, which is mightiest among beasts, And does not turn away for any;
30:31 The greyhound; the he-goat also; And the king against whom there is no rising up.
30:32 If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, Or if you have thought evil, [Put] your hand on your mouth.
30:33 For the churning of milk brings forth butter, And the wringing of the nose brings forth blood; So the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.
31:1 The words of King Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.
31:2 What, my son? And what, O son of my womb? And what, O son of my vows?
31:3 Don't give your strength to women, Nor your ways to [those women who] destroy kings.
31:4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; Nor for princes to desire strong drink.
31:5 Or else they will drink, and forget the law, And pervert the justice [due] to any who is afflicted.
31:6 Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish, And wine to the bitter in soul:
31:7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, And remember his misery no more.
31:8 Open your mouth for the mute, In the cause of all such as are left desolate.
31:9 Open your mouth, judge righteously, And give justice to the poor and needy.
31:10 A worthy woman who can find? For her price is far above rubies.
31:11 The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no lack of gain.
31:12 She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.
31:13 She seeks wool and flax, And works willingly with her hands.
31:14 She is like the merchant-ships; She brings her bread from far.
31:15 She rises also while it is yet night, And gives food to her household, And their task to her maidens.
31:16 She considers a field, and buys it; With the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
31:17 She girds her loins with strength, And makes her arms strong.
31:18 She perceives that her merchandise is profitable: Her lamp does not go out by night.
31:19 She lays her hands to the distaff, And her hands hold the spindle.
31:20 She stretches out her hand to the poor; Yes, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.
31:21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household; For all her household has double clothes.
31:22 She makes for herself carpets of tapestry; Her clothing is fine linen and purple.
31:23 Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land.
31:24 She makes linen garments and sells them, And delivers belts to the merchant.
31:25 Strength and majesty are her clothing; And she laughs at the time to come.
31:26 She opens her mouth with wisdom; And the law of kindness is on her tongue.
31:27 She looks well to the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness.
31:28 Her sons rise up, and call her blessed; Her husband [also], and he praises her, [saying]:
31:29 Many daughters have done worthily, But you excel them all.
31:30 Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; [But] a woman who fears Yahweh, she will be praised.
31:31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; And let her works praise her in the gates.
