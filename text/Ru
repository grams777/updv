1:1 And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. 
1:2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there. 
1:3 And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons. 
1:4 And they took themselves wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years. 
1:5 And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.
1:6 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread. 
1:7 And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. 
1:8 And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> to her mother's house: Yahweh deal kindly with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, as you<sup><small>+</small></sup> have dealt with the dead, and with me. 
1:9 Yahweh grant you<sup><small>+</small></sup> that you<sup><small>+</small></sup> may find rest, each of you<sup><small>+</small></sup> in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept. 
1:10 And they said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people. 
1:11 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will you<sup><small>+</small></sup> go with me? Have I yet sons inside me, that they may be your<sup><small>+</small></sup> husbands? 
1:12 Turn again, my daughters, go your<sup><small>+</small></sup> way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons; 
1:13 would you<sup><small>+</small></sup> therefore tarry until they were grown? Would you<sup><small>+</small></sup> therefore refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, for it grieves me much for your<sup><small>+</small></sup> sakes, for the hand of Yahweh has gone forth against me. 
1:14 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth stuck to her.
1:15 And she said, Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people, and to her god. You return after your sister-in-law! 
1:16 And Ruth said, Don't entreat me to leave you, and to return from following after you, for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people will be my people, and your God my God; 
1:17 where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried: Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts you and me. 
1:18 And when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.
1:19 So they both went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they had come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and [the women] said, Is this Naomi? 
1:20 And she said to them, Don't call me Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. 
1:21 I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty; why do you<sup><small>+</small></sup> call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me? 
1:22 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
2:1 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz. 
2:2 And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose eyes I will find favor. And she said to her, Go, my daughter. 
2:3 And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and by chance she happened on the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. 
2:4 And, look, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Yahweh be with you<sup><small>+</small></sup>. And they answered him, Yahweh bless you. 
2:5 Then Boaz said to his attendant who was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? 
2:6 And the attendant who was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabite damsel who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: 
2:7 And she said, Let me glean, I pray you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and has remained standing from morning until now; her sitting now in the house [has only been] for a moment.
2:8 Then said Boaz to Ruth, Do you not hear, my daughter? Don't go to glean in another field, neither pass from here, but stick here by my maidens. 
2:9 Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them: have I not charged the young men that they will not touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn. 
2:10 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner? 
2:11 And Boaz answered and said to her, It has fully been shown to me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your nativity, and have come to a people who you didn't know before. 
2:12 Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you came to take refuge. 
2:13 Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and you have spoken kindly to your female slave, though I am not as one of your female slaves.
2:14 And at mealtime Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and he passed to her roasted grain, and she ate, and was sufficed, and left of it. 
2:15 And when she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don't reproach her. 
2:16 And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don't rebuke her.
2:17 So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. 
2:18 And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed. 
2:19 And her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? And where have you wrought? Blessed be he who took knowledge of you. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought today is Boaz. 
2:20 And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us, one of our near kinsmen. 
2:21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You will stick by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest. 
2:22 And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they don't meet you in any other field. 
2:23 So she stuck by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.
3:1 And Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you? 
3:2 And now isn't Boaz our kinsman, whose maidens you were with? Look, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing-floor. 
3:3 Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself, and put your raiment on you, and go down to the threshing-floor, but don't make yourself known to the man, until he is done eating and drinking. 
3:4 And it will be, when he lies down, that you will mark the place where he will lie, and you will go in, and uncover his feet, and lay down; and he will tell you what you will do. 
3:5 And she said to her, All that you say I will do.
3:6 And she went down to the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her. 
3:7 And when Boaz had ate and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid down. 
3:8 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and saw that a woman lay at his feet. 
3:9 And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth your slave: spread therefore your skirt over your slave; for you are a near kinsman. 
3:10 And he said, Blessed be you of Yahweh, my daughter: you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you didn't follow young men, whether poor or rich. 
3:11 And now, my daughter, don't be afraid; I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman. 
3:12 And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; nevertheless there is a kinsman nearer than I. 
3:13 Tarry this night, and it will be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, good; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then I will do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives: lie down until the morning.
3:14 And she lay at his feet until the morning. And she rose up before a man could discern another. For he said, Don't let it be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor. 
3:15 And he said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city. 
3:16 And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her. 
3:17 And she said, These six [measures] of barley he gave me; for he said, Don't go empty to your mother-in-law. 
3:18 Then she said, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has finished the thing this day.
4:1 Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there: and, look, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! Turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down. 
4:2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit<sup><small>+</small></sup> down here. And they sat down. 
4:3 And he said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come again out of the country of Moab, sells the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's: 
4:4 And I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it. 
4:5 Then Boaz said, The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you buy from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance. 
4:6 And the near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, or else I will mar my own inheritance: you take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can't redeem it.
4:7 Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his sandal, and gave it to his fellow man; and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel. 
4:8 So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself. And he drew off his sandal. 
4:9 And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You<sup><small>+</small></sup> are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi. 
4:10 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead will not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you<sup><small>+</small></sup> are witnesses this day. 
4:11 And all the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, who both built the house of Israel: and do worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem: 
4:12 and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh will give you of this young woman.
4:13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son. 
4:14 And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel. 
4:15 And he will be to you a restorer of soul, and a nourisher of your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him. 
4:16 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and was its nurse. 
4:17 And her women neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they named him Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
4:18 Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron, 
4:19 and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab, 
4:20 and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmah, 
4:21 and Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed, 
4:22 and Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David.
