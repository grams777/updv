1:1 The Song of songs, which is Solomon's.
1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; For your love is better than wine.
1:3 Your oils have a goodly fragrance; Your name is oil poured forth; Therefore the young women love you.
1:4 Draw me; we will run after you: The king has brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in you; We will make mention of your love more than of wine: Rightly they love you.
1:5 I am black, but comely, O you<sup><small>+</small></sup> daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon.
1:6 Don't look on me, because I am swarthy, Because the sun has scorched me. My mother's sons were incensed against me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; [But] my own vineyard I have not kept.
1:7 Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, Where you shepherd [your flock], Where you make [it] to rest at noon: For why should I be as one who is veiled Beside the flocks of your fellow shepherds?
1:8 If you don't know, O you most beautiful among women, Go your way forth by the footsteps of the flock, And shepherd your young goats beside the shepherds' tents.
1:9 I have compared you, O my love, To a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.
1:10 Your cheeks are comely with plaits [of hair], Your neck with strings of jewels.
1:11 We will make you plaits of gold With studs of silver.
1:12 While the king sat at his table, My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.
1:13 My beloved is to me [as] a bundle of myrrh, That lies between my breasts.
1:14 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna-flowers In the vineyards of En-gedi.
1:15 Look, you are beautiful, my love; Look you are beautiful; Your eyes are doves.
1:16 Look, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant: Also our couch is green.
1:17 The beams of our house are cedars, [And] our rafters are firs.
2:1 I am a rose of Sharon, A lily of the valleys.
2:2 As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.
2:3 As the apple-tree among the trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
2:4 He brought me to the banqueting-house, And his banner over me was love.
2:5 Stregthen<sup><small>+</small></sup> me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am sick from love.
2:6 His left hand [is] under my head, And his right hand embraces me.
2:7 I adjure you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, or by the hinds of the field, That you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not stir up, nor awake [my] love, Until he pleases.
2:8 The voice of my beloved! Look, he comes, Leaping on the mountains, Skipping on the hills.
2:9 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: Look, he stands behind our wall; He looks in at the windows; He glances through the lattice.
2:10 My beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.
2:11 For, look, the winter is past; The rain is over and gone;
2:12 The flowers appear on the earth; The time of the singing [of birds] has come, And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land;
2:13 The fig tree ripens her green figs, And the vines are in blossom; They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.
2:14 O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the steep place, Let me see your countenance, Let me hear your voice; For sweet is your voice, and your countenance is comely.
2:15 Take for us the foxes, the little foxes, That spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in blossom.
2:16 My beloved is mine, and I am his: He shepherds [his flock] among the lilies.
2:17 Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart On the mountains of Bether.
3:1 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I did not find him.
3:2 [I said], I will rise now, and go about the city; In the streets and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I did not find him.
3:3 The watchmen who go about the city found me; [To whom I said], Did you<sup><small>+</small></sup> see him whom my soul loves?
3:4 It was but a little while that I passed from them, When I found him whom my soul loves: I held him, and would not let him go, Until I had brought him into my mother's house, And into the chamber of her who became pregnant with me.
3:5 I adjure you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, or by the hinds of the field, That you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not stir up, nor awake [my] love, Until he pleases.
3:6 Who is this that comes up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all powders of the merchant?
3:7 Look, it is the litter of Solomon; Threescore mighty men are about it, Of the mighty men of Israel.
3:8 All of them handle the sword, [and] are expert in war: Every man has his sword on his thigh, Because of fear in the night.
3:9 King Solomon made himself a palanquin Of the wood of Lebanon.
3:10 He made its pillars of silver, Its bottom of gold, its seat of purple, The midst of it being paved with love, From the daughters of Jerusalem.
3:11 Go forth, O you<sup><small>+</small></sup> daughters of Zion, and look at King Solomon, With the crown with which his mother has crowned him In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart.
4:1 Look, you are beautiful, my love; look, you are beautiful; Your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of mount Gilead.
4:2 Your teeth are like a flock [of ewes] that are [newly] shorn, Which have come up from the washing, Of which everyone has twins, And none is bereaved among them.
4:3 Your lips are like a thread of scarlet, And your mouth is comely. Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind your veil.
4:4 Your neck is like the tower of David Built for an armory, On which hang a thousand bucklers, All the shields of the mighty men.
4:5 Your two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe, Which feed among the lilies.
4:6 Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get myself to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.
4:7 You are entirely beautiful, my love; And there is no spot in you.
4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, [my] bride, With me from Lebanon: Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions' dens, From the mountains of the leopards.
4:9 You have ravished my heart, my sister, [my] bride; You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, With one chain of your neck.
4:10 How fair is your love, my sister, [my] bride! How much better is your love than wine! And the fragrance of your oils than all manner of spices!
4:11 Your lips, O [my] bride, drop [as] the honeycomb: Honey and milk are under your tongue; And the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
4:12 A garden shut up is my sister, [my] bride; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
4:13 Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants,
4:14 Spikenard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.
4:15 [You are] a fountain of gardens, A well of living waters, And flowing streams from Lebanon.
4:16 Awake, O north wind; and come, you south; Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat his precious fruits.
5:1 I have come into my garden, my sister, [my] bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drank my wine with my milk. Eat, O companions; Drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.
5:2 I was asleep, but my heart awoke: It is the voice of my beloved who knocks, [saying,] Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.
5:3 I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
5:4 My beloved put in his hand through the hole, And my insides were moved for him.
5:5 I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, On the handles of the bolt.
5:6 I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself, [and] was gone. My soul had failed me when he spoke: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
5:7 The watchmen who go about the city found me, They struck me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.
5:8 I adjure you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, O daughters of Jerusalem, If you<sup><small>+</small></sup> find my beloved, That you<sup><small>+</small></sup> tell him, that I am sick from love.
5:9 What is your beloved more than [another] beloved, O you most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than [another] beloved, That you so adjure us?
5:10 My beloved is white and ruddy, The chiefest among ten thousand.
5:11 His head is the most fine gold; His locks are bushy, [and] black as a raven.
5:12 His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, Washed with milk, [and] fitly set.
5:13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, [As] banks of sweet herbs: His lips are lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.
5:14 His hands are rings of gold set with beryl: His insides are ivory work overlaid [with] sapphires.
5:15 His legs are pillars of marble, set on sockets of fine gold: His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
5:16 His mouth is most sweet; Yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my companion, O daughters of Jerusalem.
6:1 Where has your beloved gone, O you most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned, That we may seek him with you?
6:2 My beloved has gone down to his garden, To the beds of spices, To shepherd in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
6:3 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine; He shepherds [his flock] among the lilies,
6:4 You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Terrible as an army with banners.
6:5 Turn away your eyes from me, For they have overcome me. Your hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of Gilead.
6:6 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, Which have come up from the washing; Of which everyone has twins, And none is bereaved among them.
6:7 Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind your veil.
6:8 There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, And young women without number.
6:9 My dove, my undefiled, is [but] one; She is the only one of her mother; She is the choice one of her who bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; [Yes,] the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
6:10 Who is she who looks forth as the morning, Beautiful as the moon, Clear as the sun, Terrible as an army with banners?
6:11 I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the green plants of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, [And] the pomegranates were in flower.
6:12 Before I was aware, my soul set me [Among] the chariots of my princely people.
6:13 Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look at you. Why will you<sup><small>+</small></sup> look at the Shulammite, As on the dance of Mahanaim?
7:1 How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of a skillful workman.
7:2 Your body is [like] a round goblet, [In which] no mingled wine is wanting: Your waist is [like] a heap of wheat Set about with lilies.
7:3 Your two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe.
7:4 Your neck is like the tower of ivory; Your eyes [as] the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon Which looks toward Damascus.
7:5 Your head on you is like Carmel, And the hair of your head like purple; The king is held captive in the tresses [of it].
7:6 How fair and how pleasant are you, [O] love, daughter of delight.
7:7 Your stature is like a palm-tree, And your breasts to its clusters.
7:8 I said, I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of its branches: Let your breasts be as clusters of the vine, And the smell of your breath like apples,
7:9 And your mouth like the best wine, That goes down smoothly for my beloved, Gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.
7:10 I am my beloved's; And his desire is toward me.
7:11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; Let us lodge in the villages.
7:12 Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine has budded, [And] its blossom is open, [And] the pomegranates are in flower: There I will give you my love.
7:13 The mandrakes give forth fragrance; And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, Which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.
8:1 Oh that you were as my brother, Who nursed the breasts of my mother! [When] I should find you outside, I would kiss you; Yes, and none would despise me.
8:2 I would lead you, [and] bring you into my mother's house, Who would instruct me; I would cause you to drink of spiced wine, Of the juice of my pomegranate.
8:3 His left hand [should be] under my head, And his right hand should embrace me.
8:4 I adjure you<sup><small>+</small></sup>, O daughters of Jerusalem, That you<sup><small>+</small></sup> do not stir up, nor awake [my] love, Until he pleases.
8:5 Who is this that comes up from the wilderness, Leaning on her beloved? Under the apple-tree I awakened you: There your mother was in travail with you, There she who brought you forth was in travail.
8:6 Set me as a seal on your heart, As a seal on your arm: For love is as strong as death; Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol; The flashes of it are flashes of fire, An intense flame of Yahweh.
8:7 Many waters can't quench love, Neither can floods drown it: If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, He would be completely despised.
8:8 We have a little sister, And she has no breasts: What shall we do for our sister In the day when she will be spoken for?
8:9 If she is a wall, We will build on her a turret of silver: And if she is a door, We will enclose her with boards of cedar.
8:10 I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers [of it]: Then I was in his eyes as one who found peace.
8:11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He let out the vineyard to keepers; Every one for its fruit was to bring a thousand [shekels] of silver.
8:12 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: You, O Solomon, will have the thousand, And those who keep its fruit two hundred.
8:13 You who dwell in the gardens, My fellow shepherds listen for your voice: Cause me to hear it.
8:14 Hurry, my beloved, And be like a roe or a young hart On the mountains of spices.
